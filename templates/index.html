    <div class="intro-section">
        <p>Hi. I'm a journalist and writer based in Bombay, though I'm still figuring out what that means exactly. I spend my days asking questions that don't have clean answers—about truth and power, and what it means to live meaningfully in a complex world.</p> 
        
        <p>Writing, for me, is both craft and compulsion, the way I make sense of the eternal tension between wanting to enjoy life and feeling called to change it. (It's messier than it sounds, which is probably why I keep writing about it.)</p>
        
        <hr>

        <p>I lead content and community at <strong><a href="https://thewholetruthfoods.com/" target="_blank">The Whole Truth</a></strong>, a food brand built on the principle of radical transparency to rebuild the world's trust in its food. </p>
        
        <p>I'm also building <strong><a href="https://www.theplankmag.com" target="_blank">The Plank</a></strong>, a citizen-first magazine for readers who believe journalism should serve curiosity over conclusions. (The magazine is on a hiatus, and we will be back soon.) </p>
        
        <p>Both feel like small attempts to push back against a world that often feels designed to mislead.</p>

        <hr>
        
        <p>My journalism started with data and numbers at <em>The Hindu</em> and <em>Hindustan Times</em>, but I soon discovered that the most interesting stories happen in the spaces between disciplines. I moved into long-form writing and investigations, launched newsletters, built a freelance practice that lets me follow curiosity wherever it leads—from the politics of data to mechanics of misinformation to the economics of media itself.</p> 
        
        <p>I have written for <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>Mint</em>, <em>Rest of World</em> and others. I've also written personal essays, because sometimes the most important journalism is the kind that starts with admitting what you don't know about yourself.</p>

        <p>I studied mathematics and computing at IIT Kanpur. In 2018, I was an Alfred Friendly Press Partners fellow, working with The Wall Street Journal's data and investigations team in New York. I am also an <a href="https://www.mercatus.org/emergent-ventures">Emergent Ventures</a> awardee.</p>
