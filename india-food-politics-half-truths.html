    <hr>


<p><img src="assets/images/interval-banner.png" /></p>
<p><em>This story was originally published in my fortnightly deep-dive
newsletter, <strong>The Interval</strong>.</em> You can read more about
it <a href="./welcome-to-the-interval.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Journalists are hard-wired to look for
instances of shadowy wrongdoing. This is especially true for stories
that involve cronyism, conflict of interest or payoffs in scientific
research and/or regulatory policy. But a <em><a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/health/ilsi-food-policy-india-brazil-china.html">New
York Times</a></em> story that called out a prominent Indian
scientist—overseeing packaged labelling in India—shows how this bias can
lead to bad reporting and misinformation. Even when there is smoke,
there isn’t always fire. It’s a 15-minute read.</p>
<hr />
<p>Imagine a hypothetical scenario. Journalists in five different
newsrooms start chasing a story. An activist alerts all of them to a
potential case of corruption: a senior bureaucrat might be tweaking
policy to favour a real-estate developer. The reporters start
digging.</p>
<p>One finds connections: the duo go for a golf outing every month,
their kids study in the same school, and travel records show both
holidayed in Spain last summer. The newspaper splashes this scandalous
‘scoop’ on its front page.</p>
<p>The other four reporters have the same information but their editors
want more. “This only suggests these guys are friends,” says an editor
“but it does not show if and how the rules are being tweaked to favour
this guy and what happened inside the government. Show me that. Get me
the evidence.”</p>
<p>They continue digging. They interview several people. They access
internal government records. But they can’t find any solid evidence.
Instead, the opposite happens: they find holes in the corruption
hypothesis. The bureaucrat had rejected proposals that favoured his
friend. He was following due process.</p>
<p>“This means there is no story here. It’s just hearsay,” says the
editor. “Keep an eye out for potential leads. But drop this for now. Go
work on something else.”</p>
<p>Journalists move on. End of story.</p>
<p>Look what just happened here. Five reporters, from five newsrooms,
worked on the same story, but the public gets to know about one. They
only know of one because the other four did not publish. They only got
to read the accusatory story establishing friendship. They may even laud
the ‘courageous reporter’ and the ‘gutsy publication’ to expose the
‘state-capital nexus’.</p>
<p>But the contradictory findings of the other four remain an internal
record because “we did not find the bureaucrat favoured his friend” is
not considered news. That is normal — and normal things don’t make
news.</p>
<p>But the fact is that journalists worked on it and found ‘nothing’ —
and ‘nothing’ is a finding. It is what I call a ‘null story’.</p>
<p>Null stories are not appealing: the reporter and the publication have
no incentive to say ‘we know there is a problem but we don’t know who is
behind it and all we know is the story of that other guy is
misleading.’</p>
<p>This ‘publication bias’ of not carrying null stories is a
journalistic blind spot: it allows half-baked claims to circulate in the
public discourse which distorts our understanding of complex issues,
gives birth to conspiracy theories, and diverts our attention away from
what’s really happening in the world.</p>
<p>This is especially so in stories involving money, power and
politics.</p>
<p>In today’s edition of <strong>The Interval</strong>, I will tell you
a ‘null story’ on India’s food politics featuring a shady research
organisation, a scientist, dubious statistics and a propaganda campaign
to promote sugar. And I will make a case for publishing null stories.
It’s not just about media critique: refutations are fundamental to the
truth-seeking process.  </p>
<hr />
<h2 id="i.-indias-labelling-policy-and-nytreport"><strong>I. India’s
labelling policy and NYTreport</strong></h2>
<p>In September 2019, the <em>New York Times</em> published a <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/health/ilsi-food-policy-india-brazil-china.html">bombshell
report</a>: <strong>“A Shadowy Industry Group Shapes Food Policy Around
the World!”</strong></p>
<p>It begins with a discussion on India’s progressive front-of-pack
labelling regulation. (It was introduced to solve the problem of
misleading “healthy food” labels I had discussed in the <a
href="./shark-tank-india-health-food-claims-truth.html">previous
issue</a>.)</p>
<p>The idea of the regulation is simple. From a story I wrote for <em><a
href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/food-warning-labels-are-in-the-deep-freeze-11613403030011.html">Mint</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If the content of fat, salt or sugar—the three nutrients of
concern—exceed a specified quantity, the food packet would come with a
front-of-pack warning label. An easily understandable red dot for each
element that surpasses a defined threshold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The front-of-pack label, its advocates believe, would empower
consumers in making informed choices and incentivise companies to
innovate in food technology to bring down fat, salt and sugar
levels.</p>
<p>The regulation is stuck for around six years now following fierce
opposition from the food industry.</p>
<p>The NYT report offered a clue for these delays: the appointment of a
specific scientist to shape this regulation.</p>
<p><strong>Here is what happened:</strong> The first draft of this
policy came out in 2018. Industry executives expectedly expressed
concerns. So, the FSSAI, India’s food regulator, set up a three-member
expert panel to consult stakeholders and propose revisions.</p>
<p>This panel was headed by Dr Boindala Sesikeran. This, the NYT told
us, was a problem. Here are the first three paragraphs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When the Indian government bowed to powerful food companies last year
and postponed its decision to put red warning labels on unhealthy
packaged food, officials also sought to placate critics of the delay by
creating an expert panel to review the proposed labeling system, which
would have gone far beyond what other countries have done in the battle
to combat soaring obesity rates.</p>
<p>But the man chosen to head the three-person committee, Dr. Boindala
Sesikeran, a veteran nutritionist and former adviser to Nestle, only
further enraged health advocates.</p>
<p>That’s because Dr. Sesikeran is a trustee of the International Life
Sciences Institute, an American nonprofit with an innocuous sounding
name that has been quietly infiltrating government health and nutrition
bodies around the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sesikaran’s presence in the expert committee, health advocates told
the NYT, is not acceptable: “To have a covert food lobby group deciding
public health policy is wrong and a blatant conflict of interest,” one
activist told the publication.</p>
<p>The report then dives deep into the history of the
<strong>International Life Sciences Institute</strong> (ILSI): it
“championed tobacco interests during the 1980s and 1990s”; it’s “China
affiliate helped shape anti-obesity education campaigns that stressed
physical activity over dietary changes, a strategy long espoused by
Coca-Cola”; studies showing how members strategised the need to “step up
their fight against the W.H.O.’s increasingly tough stance on
sugar.”</p>
<p>This shady track record of ILSI suggested that Dr Sesikaran is up to
something.</p>
<p><em>Down to Earth</em>, a fortnightly magazine published by the New
Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment — whose director was
quoted in the NYT story and whose members were consulted on this policy
— <a
href="https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/food/junk-food-monster-delays-and-dilutions-weakening-public-health-68422">published
an article</a> which said the “report of the 2018 committee, headed by
Sesikeran, has never been made public. But it is this committee which
brought in the most industry-friendly changes.”</p>
<p>I was intrigued. What is in that report? How exactly is Sesikeran
tweaking the rules and whom will it benefit?</p>
<p>None of this information was available. So I filed a request under
India’s Right to Information Act to get records of these expert group
meetings to find out what Sesikaran had done.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ii.-things-are-not-what-they-seem-on-the-surface"><strong>II.
“Things are not what they seem on the surface”</strong></h2>
<p>What did the documents reveal?</p>
<p>Sesikaran’s group met thrice between September and December 2018. In
the first meeting on September 7, the group introduced a few changes.
From my <em>Mint</em> article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The changes they introduced included modifying the ingredients that
would determine what is an HFSS food: in the new definition, high sugar
would refer to ‘added sugar’, not ‘total sugar’; high fat would focus on
‘saturated fat’, not ‘total fat’; and salt was replaced with sodium.
Limits were modified accordingly.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reasons were given for this change but critics said these were done
to please the industry. It’s debatable.</p>
<p>But two things in those documents caught my attention.</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> While activists pointed out that changing
‘total sugar’  to ‘added sugar’ on the label was an industry-friendly
move, meeting minutes revealed otherwise.</p>
<p>In the October 8 2018 meeting, industry representatives opposed what
Sesikaran’s group had proposed. They wanted ‘total sugar’ as a mandatory
declaration and ‘added sugar’ as voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>Two: </strong>In the meeting on 27 December 2018, the
representatives of the Indian Sugar Mills Association came in as special
invitees to make a case against the labelling policy.</p>
<p>The association has not come across any report regarding the adverse
effects of sugar consumption, they told the panel. Sugar is an essential
part of the diet, an inexpensive source of energy, and India’s per
capita consumption of sugar is the lowest in the world. So putting a red
mark on the pack — which will discourage the consumer from consuming it
— for sugar levels beyond a threshold is not a good idea, they said.</p>
<p>Meeting minutes show that Sesikaran countered them. Most people do
not have the capability to read the labels, he told the sugar lobby, and
colour coding matters because it is easy for consumers to understand.
The thresholds were based on WHO standards and they were not targeting
sugar in isolation — fat and salt were part of the regulation, too.</p>
<p>Another scientist in the panel made it clear: “systematic data is
available regarding excessive sugar consumption and its adverse health
effects”.</p>
<p>Information from these government records complicates the NYT and
Down to Earth narrative. While I can’t — and I don’t want to — prove
that Sesikaran is an innocent scientist, it does suggest he wasn’t
always behaving like some food industry automaton. He actually showed
some independence.</p>
<p>More contradictions appear in the Sesikaran narrative.</p>
<hr />
<h2
id="iii.-the-failed-pr-campaign-you-are-not-eating-enough-sugar">III.
The failed PR campaign: “You are not eating enough sugar”</h2>
<p>In October 2020, nearly two years after the Sesikaran meeting,
India’s sugar lobby (ISMA) started a bizarre public relations campaign.
The association launched a new portal — meetha.org — to fight the
‘misinformation surrounding sugar’.</p>
<p>India’s union food secretary was present at the website launch.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/food-politics-half-truths/meetha.png" /></p>
<p>On a Zoom call, the association’s director-general Abhinash Verma
told me the origin story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have been attending a lot of conferences and meetings at the
international level and we are concerned about the campaign that is
going on against sugar to make everybody believe that if you reduce your
sugar consumption you will be the healthiest person in the world. This
campaign is getting bigger and bigger in India.</p>
<p>Someone is behind this campaign without much research. We realized
that none of these scientists, anywhere in the world, have ever
concluded that sugar is bad. Nobody, be it doctors or nutritionists will
tell you that consuming sugar per se will lead to diabetes or dental
caries or will increase your chances of getting cancer.</p>
<p>So as a responsible association of sugar producers, we have started a
small campaign to discuss in a public forum what is correct and what is
incorrect. Our meetha.org could be the platform to convey the right
details and fill the vacuum.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Verma spoke to me for close to an hour. He clarified: they are not
asking people to eat more sugar. They are asking for moderation and
busting misconceptions which are leading to misguided policies like
front-of-pack labelling.</p>
<p>I wrote about sugar in <strong>The Interval’s</strong> <a
href="./shark-tank-india-health-food-claims-truth.html">previous
issue</a> and I won’t get into the specifics here. As Daniel Engber
pointed out in a fine <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/the-sugar-wars/508751/">Atlantic
essay</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the history defies a simple reading, the research on
nutrition—ample and diverse though it’s been—isn’t close to dispositive.
We can’t prove the case against sugar, and we can’t prove the case
against that case, either.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This campaign has terribly failed which is why you have probably
never heard about it. Their YouTube channel has only four subscribers
and their Twitter account has less than 200 followers.</p>
<p>What matters for this discussion is the sugar association’s stunning
claim: Indians are not eating enough sugar.</p>
<p>The per-capita consumption of sugar in India is 19gm per day, they
said, which is much lower than the recommended 30gm/day by ICMR and 50gm
per day standard by WHO.</p>
<p>If sugar consumption is so controlled, what is the fuss about?</p>
<p>These numbers come from a government survey done by the National
Institute of Nutrition. But they are hard to believe and they don’t
stack up with other data sources I checked.</p>
<p>Critics soon found a hint: ILSI was the partner in this <a
href="https://www.nin.res.in/survey_reports/sugar_study_report_part-1.pdf">survey</a>,
suggesting that the numbers could possibly be fudged to promote the case
made by the sugar industry.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is possible. Let’s say ILSI influenced the study to get the
numbers favouring the sugar industry.</p>
<p>But now, go back to those closed-door government meetings where
lobbyists have the most power to skew things. And there, Sesikaran —
ILSI’s own trustee — had rejected these bogus arguments of the sugar
lobby. The fact that their case was not accepted by the food regulator
panel was partly the reason they launched this PR campaign.</p>
<p>So which theory should we accept?</p>
<p>The claims against Sesikaran just don’t add up.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-the-wrong-target"><strong>IV. “The wrong
target”</strong></h2>
<p>The questions that emerged from my reporting got me thinking:
Sesikaran, perhaps, may not be the villain the press is telling us he
is.</p>
<p>His view on this whole controversy was not publicly available. So I
called him this week to understand what he had to say.</p>
<p>“If what I said in the committee meetings is made public, everyone
will know fully if there was any kind of hanky-panky in the committee’s
decision. It should have been transparent for the public to know,” he
told me.</p>
<p>Soon after the <em>New York Times</em> story, Sesikaran wrote to the
FSSAI: “Don’t be hesitant. If you say, I will step down. I have been on
several committees. You know my track record. If there is anything that
indicates that I have a bias, you can always haul me up or if you want
me to leave the FSSAI committee, I can do that too,” he said.</p>
<p>The FSSAI didn’t respond or say anything. So he continued to attend a
few more meetings after that (he was a member of multiple committees).
But that was the time his term in the FSSAI was about to end (scientific
member participants have to periodically renew their terms). At the time
of renewal, he did not send his name, nor did the FSSAI ask him to.</p>
<p>“That’s how it ended,” he said.</p>
<p>“The industry has direct access to FSSAI,” he told me. “They have
their own channels, and they have been working through those channels.
ILSI has never represented on behalf of the industry.”</p>
<p>On the phone, Sesikaran made a strong case for better labels. “The
industry needs to put the front of pack labels and they need to provide
more information. There is no going back or second thought on this,” he
said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is quite disappointing. We spend our entire lives setting dietary
guidelines and RDAs and all that and just on the basis of an association
with another thing people are making these comments about me,” Sesikaran
said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But let’s be clear here: Another expert who had worked on the
labelling policy told me there is no doubt that the food industry has a
deep-rooted influence inside India’s regulator. But Sesikaran is the
wrong target. “It’s been close to three years since he is out of this
panel, and nothing has moved. How do you explain that?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As food scientists, we work with the industry and we work with the
government. And we offer our expertise. Don’t cast aspersions on us
without evidence.”</p>

<p>I took what I found to <a
href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/david_johns/">David Merritt
Johns</a>, a public health historian at the Yale School of Public
Health.</p>
<p>His excellent 2018 paper in <em><a
href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaq1618">Science</a></em>
— debunking a manufactured “sugar conspiracy” — with Gerald M.
Oppenheimer partly pushed me to write this ‘null story’. [</p>
<p>Was there ever really a “sugar conspiracy”?</p>
<p>Twists and turns in science and policy are not necessarily products
of malevolence</p>
<p>From their article in <em><a
href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/03/big-sugar-isnt-to-blame-for-steering-us-away-from-fat.html">Slate</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last two decades a remarkable shift in focus has taken place
in the nutrition field—we’ve gone from blaming fat for our expanding
waistlines to fingering sugar instead.</p>
<p>And who was to blame for our nutritional befuddlement?</p>
<p>In late 2016, there emerged an explanation that appeared to cut
through the fog: It was the sugar industry. Researchers with the
University of California announced they had unearthed secret archival
documents showing that in the mid-1960s, the industry-backed Sugar
Research Foundation had covertly paid top scientists at Harvard to
conduct a literature review playing down the role of sugar in heart
disease and pinning the blame on dietary fat instead.</p>
<p>But as we detailed last month in Science, our own examination of the
historical events in question shows this alluring tale of industry
meddling is based on a highly selective and profoundly flawed
interpretation of the history.</p>
<p>The long-deceased Mad Men–era Harvard scientists who stand accused of
having been “paid off” to “shift the blame” to fat were, in fact,
already on record in support of low-fat diets as a way to fight heart
disease for nearly a decade before the sugar men came calling. In
adopting this stance they were in sync with the dominant nutritional
paradigm of the era: the idea that the fatty American diet, by raising
cholesterol levels in the blood, was behind the epidemic of heart
attacks that was killing so many middle-aged breadwinners. No
blame-shifting was even required!</p>
<p>So what explains the emergence of this shadowy narrative about Big
Sugar? Certainly there is a rich tradition in contested areas of science
of using bits and pieces of history to add urgency to one’s claims.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Sesikaran-ILSI saga had similarities with this case. So I emailed
David to get his views on what I had found in my reporting.</p>
<p>Here is our email exchange, slightly edited for clarity:</p>
<p><strong>Samarth</strong>: What do you think about the journalistic
adage of “follow the money”?  This is what editors tell their reporters
looking to expose corruption. While this connection can be informative,
it can sometimes be stretched too far. Just a hint of a funding
connection from X to Y is considered enough to explain the behaviour of
Y. In my own reporting, I have seen that it is a good starting point but
it is often not the full story. It appears that your research on the
nutrition wars is suggesting the same. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>David Johns:</strong> “It is always a good idea to follow the
money. Money makes things happen. And very often things don’t or cannot
happen in the absence of money.</p>
<p>That said, there is no question that it has become a popular academic
and journalistic trope to seek out financial connections and then use
those ties to discredit some public figure, or to use those ties to
explain why one (bad) thing happened while another (good) thing
didn’t.”</p>
<p><strong>Samarth:</strong> What are its implications for our
understanding of complex issues in food policy? What do we miss out
on?</p>
<p><strong>David Johns:</strong> “One relevant point in the journalistic
realm is that I think there has been a tendency to focus on and demonize
particular individual scientists who have had or do have relationships
with industry, rather than consider how the industry’s activities as a
whole might tend to amplify certain ideas and arguments that align with
the industry’s interests.</p>
<p>If the conferences are set up in such a way that they amplify certain
industry-friendly messages (e.g., they promote exercise instead of
denigrating junk food), then maybe you have academic articles are
published as a result of the conference. Maybe journalists cover the
conference, and they transmit that message.</p>
<p>So the industry can influence the conversation and shape the science
and policy even if the scientists themselves are not at all shills of
the kind you would imagine from the movies (i.e., slimeballs who take
the industry money and then do the industry’s bidding without regard or
whether it’s right or wrong).</p>
<p>Industry achieves its goals simply by amplifying the part of the
story that aligns with its interests.</p>
<p>It’s true that the scientists who play along may be abetting the
industry in ways they don’t even realize; but that’s different from
suggesting that X thing happened because of the industry’s influence
(e.g., “the sugar industry paid off Harvard scientists and that’s why we
got the low-fat diet!”)”</p>
<p><strong>Samarth:</strong> So in the simple “follow the money” mental
model, the scientist is guilty. But just because I can’t show that he
has done something wrong, that doesn’t mean he has not done anything
wrong. Maybe I am a bad reporter who was not able to uncover what he had
done in the background?</p>
<p>So one can say: sure, their evidence is weak, but pointing out that
someone else’s evidence is weak may be read as a defence of that person
— which is not what I want to do. I wonder if you thought about this
while writing your paper?</p>
<p><strong>David Johns:</strong> “Yes, we were very careful for the
reasons that you mention not to suggest that we knew for sure that the
sugar industry wasn’t more influential and nefarious behind the scenes
than we realized or had been able to discover in our archival research.
But the point is that you need to have evidence for such things before
you can make strong claims.”</p>
<hr />
<p>David and his co-author aptly summed up the problem in their
<em>Slate</em> piece:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But conspiratorial tales, when not grounded in strong evidence, can
pose a real danger to our ability to make good public health policies
and understand how science actually works. Stories about clandestine
payoffs and corporate cover-ups by definition suggest that some
scandalous truth was being hidden…Avoiding these traps requires a
commitment to evidence and an appreciation for the complexity of
scientific research and its history.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is my point — a point I believe is worth endlessly repeating. We
must hold the powerful accountable and we must investigate the influence
of money in politics. But we should do that with a commitment to
evidence and the truth.</p>
<p>Informed refutations are a crucial part of the truth-seeking process
and journalists can contribute to it by finding a way to publish their
‘null stories’.</p>
