    <h1 class="post-title">The Existential Afterlife of My June Feelings</h1>
    
    
    <div class="post-meta">
        Published on June 12, 2024
    </div>
    
    
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>It’s been ages since I’ve rambled on the internet and (over)shared my
feelings. No one asked for them, no one’s waiting with bated breath—I
know.But I can’t help it. I need to get something out of me. My
narcissistic side takes its feelings so seriously that it has developed
this need to give them an afterlife beyond my inner life. (It is what it
is. And why not?)So here I go. Feelings on feelings themselves. On the significance of
insignificant things (like my daily problems). On existential
loneliness. On human relationships. On the soul-sucking bits of code
that come together as an app called Hinge. And, on kindness. (A lot,
right?)
Context first. In the last six weeks, I’ve upended my entire life. If
you’d told me six months ago that I’d leave Landour for Mumbai, take a
leadership role at a <a href="https://thewholetruthfoods.com/">fast-growing startup</a>, and
build my <a href="https://theplank.co/pitch-call">dream magazine</a>, I
would’ve laughed in disbelief. I worshipped the slow life, enjoying
leisure and nature, isolating myself from the darker side of modern
capitalism that turns us into always-on, always-producing machines.
As Freud argued in <em>Civilisation and its Discontents</em>, the demands of
civilised society often conflict with individual human instincts,
leading to widespread discontent. The repression of these instincts,
which is necessary for the functioning of society, comes at a
psychological cost.
One must see through that farce, peel down the invisible layers,
shatter illusions. The more people do this, the more they will realise
the futility of how the modern world is constructed.
And then—in what may seem like an extremely stupid move years from
now—I just reversed all of it. I walked into exactly the lifestyle I
criticised. 
Why did I do it?</p>
<p>I could give you a long-winded answer featuring logical-sounding
career moves and personal growth, but the truth is this: I felt like
doing it, so I went ahead and did it. It felt like the right thing to
do at this stage in life.
These stupid little things called feelings, which the world says one
should not take seriously, led me to change my whole world. 
And while these changes—which don’t happen every day—feel so
significant in how I experience the world, in what lies ahead, and in
the small and big problems I face every day as a result, they also feel
insignificant in the larger scheme of things.
I mean, does the fact that water stopped coming out of my water
filter this morning, a day after I got the plumbing fixed in my newly
rented apartment because the washing machine outlet was not connected to
the sewage, really mean anything when a genocide is happening in Gaza?
Have I lost my mind?
Forget the world. Even the lives of those closest to me are vastly
different from my own.
As I sent WhatsApp voice notes to friends about my Hinge experience
being so different in Bombay (more on that later), two of my married
friends were going through divorce proceedings.
As I am excited about imbuing my work with meaning, a talented
friend—whose abilities I suspect he often doubts—is trying to find a job
by gaming the corporate system, speaking their language to get in, even
if it involves deception.
As I consciously move to a big city, eager to build a new life, a
writer I once edited revealed that he had to move cities out of
circumstance—a choice he would not ideally make.
Suffering surrounds me, hidden behind the happy faces I encounter
daily. I can’t help but wonder about the secret worlds people inhabit.
What don’t I know about their experiences? And without that knowledge,
how should I behave when my own existence is the only one I fully
understand?
This is why I care deeply about my feelings, even if their intensity
may seem disproportionate to the scale of things happening in the wider
world.
Caring about my feelings acknowledges an existential reality: we are
fundamentally alone in our tiny universes. No one can fully understand
another’s subjective experience, shaped by unique perceptions, emotions,
and thoughts.
This leads to a paradox: we are alone, yet our lives gain richness
and meaning through our connections with others. 
And that’s all the more reason to tell our stories and express our
feelings. How else can we confront the dilemmas that have no right
answer? How else can we discover that we are not alone in feeling alone?
Does it make sense to you? My feelings are asking: do you see what they
want to say?</p>
<p>This is a perfect point to segue into what I have been thinking a lot
about lately: human relationships. As Yuval Noah Harari has powerfully
argued, most things around us are fictions: money, corporations,
achievements, and so on. But people? Our family, friends, colleagues,
and the strangers we encounter every day? They are real. And I now
believe that nothing matters more than how we coexist with one
another.
But pause. So much I have to say on this, but for a single man in his
thirties—just 30, though—a big part of my thinking about relationships
is centred around <a href="http://www.samarthbansal.com/romantic-idiot.html">dating</a>. And on this Wednesday evening at Subko in
Bandra, I want to share some weird realisations I’ve had about myself in
the last couple of weeks. (If possible, don’t judge.)
Something puzzling is happening with me on dating apps. On Hinge. As
a man with borderline-average looks (which is what matters most on these
algo-matchmaking bits of code), my baseline assumption is that I’m
supposed to create an account, doom scroll like a zombie, get one or two
matches in a day or two, and then try to strike up a conversation and be
fake-interesting to engage the woman, who likely has too many matches to
care. Then, I’m supposed to see if it leads to a date. It’s totally
insane, but we’ve become so habituated to it that it’s just
normalised.
But only the algo lords know what the hell is happening in Bombay: I
just keep getting matches. And it’s not just likes that lead to matches
when men like me try way too hard with the first message. Likes are
coming from the other end. I will sit, and my phone will buzz: “X has
liked you. Match to continue chat.”
That’s not all. Women in Bombay are also… talking? They initiate
conversations and reply instantly? They follow up?
Let me be clear: I am not dissing women. It’s just all of us being
weirdos on the apps. I’m simply narrating my common experience of these
broken conversations, which has apparently changed for me in the new
city. And I don’t understand why.
Good for me, I guess?</p>
<p>At first, this increased attention was exciting. More matches would
mean more conversations, which would mean a whole new world of
possibilities.
But this unfamiliar territory revealed something else: as these
matches have started coming at this frequency, and now I have so many
open chats to respond to, I don’t feel like talking to anyone. Because
while earlier this process felt off due to a lack of choice, now it
feels off because of too much choice. What are we really doing here? And
why?
I mean… part of the reason I sound so jaded is that I went on one
date that didn’t go well. I am not into bitching about bad dates on the
internet, but if you have ever been on one where right in the middle
both people know they should just go their separate ways ASAP but are
still kind of stuck together for some reason, that’s what happened to
me. Thanks, Hinge.
As more matches keep coming in, I find myself less and less inclined
to engage.
The even weirder part is that just the act of getting likes is
inducing this super odd feeling. It’s not about wanting to actually
connect with these matches or go out with them. It’s more about the
fleeting validation that comes from knowing someone—anyone—found you
attractive enough to swipe right. (It might be a potentially mindless
right swipe, but whatever.)
It’s like a momentary ego boost, a quick dopamine hit that confirms
there’s something desirable about you, even if it’s just based on a
superficial first impression. And somehow, that’s enough. That tiny dose
of attention and approval feels good, even if it doesn’t lead anywhere
meaningful.
I hate to admit it, but maybe the apps are fulfilling a need I didn’t
even know I had: the need for external validation by the opposite sex.
And now that I’m getting it in doses I’ve never experienced before, it’s
messing with my head. I thought I was above seeking validation from
strangers on the internet, but apparently not. (Sigh.)
It’s a strange realisation, to see how easily we can be influenced by
these little digital gestures of approval. They tap into some
deep-seated human desire to feel wanted, to feel attractive.  Even if
it’s all just a game.
And then the spiral continues, and I wonder: who really wants to date
like this and go on these soul-sucking dates through these soul-sucking
apps?
Whoever it might be, it’s not me.</p>
<p>What many of us secretly want—or at least what I want—is to fall
stupidly, recklessly in love. To be a character of a Jane Austen novel.
To experience that all-consuming passion, even if it means accepting the
inevitable pain (read heartbreak) that comes with it. 
And this is yet another dilemma: why would you want to voluntary sign
up for pain in your life because heartbreak really sucks — it’s messy
and devastating and it can leave you feeling like a shell of yourself.
But in a twisted way, it’s also a testament to the depth of your
feelings, to the fact that you cared so much, you dared to love so
fully. And that’s any day better than whatever is happening on these
apps. 
This is the thing about feelings. They defy all logic. Can’t help
it. </p>
<p>All of this brings me to my last point. Increasingly, among all the
virtuous things a ‘good’ human would aspire to, kindness has become my
North Star. When you are stuck in a situation and don’t know what to do,
the morally right thing is to just be kind. Simple. It’s not that
hard. 
It really matters. Hear from the always amazing George Saunders: </p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So here’s something I know to be true, although it’s a little corny,
and I don’t quite know what to do with it:
What I regret most in my life are failures of kindness.</p>
<p>Those moments when another human being was there, in front of me,
suffering, and I responded . . . sensibly. Reservedly. Mildly.
Or, to look at it from the other end of the telescope: Who, in your
life, do you remember most fondly, with the most undeniable feelings of
warmth?
Those who were kindest to you, I bet.</p>
<p>It’s a little facile, maybe, and certainly hard to implement, but I’d
say, as a goal in life, you could do worse than: Try to be kinder.
…</p>
<p>Do all the other things, the ambitious things — travel, get rich,
get famous, innovate, lead, fall in love, make and lose fortunes, swim
naked in wild jungle rivers (after first having it tested for monkey
poop) – but as you do, to the extent that you can, err in the direction
of kindness. Do those things that incline you toward the big questions,
and avoid the things that would reduce you and make you trivial. </p>
<p>The words spoke to me so deeply that I am most likely getting this
framed and putting it on my wall.
And it’s not just about being kind to the world, but a reminder to be
kind to ourselves, too. This is something I keep reminding myself in the
pages of my diary.
I don’t want to get into the details of the creative anxiety I am
dealing with at the moment (it’s normal, and there’s no point sharing it
until I create the thing I have set out to create), but living with it
is not always easy. 
So just sharing one bit I wrote as an act of self-therapy on the day
I announced The Plank, the magazine I am now building:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>“If you ever feel broken, remember: you took action. To make a small
change. To make things (slightly) better. It takes courage to follow
your conviction and trust your creative instincts. So be proud of
yourself. 
But… never let this make you feel any inflated sense of
self-importance. Never. That’s the trap. You are doing this because you
want to do it—there is no moral imperative.”</p>
<p>That’s a note to self: Work very hard. But don’t forget to be kind to
yourself.</p>
