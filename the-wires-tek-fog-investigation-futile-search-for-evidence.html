          <h1>The Wire’s TekFog investigation: A futile search for
evidence</h1>

    <hr>


<p><img src="assets/images/interval-banner.png" /></p>
<p><em>This story was originally published in my fortnightly deep-dive
newsletter, <strong>The Interval</strong>. You can read more about it <a
href="./welcome-to-the-interval.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The Wire’s recent three-part investigation
into a secret BJP app called TekFog raised great concerns about a
powerful tool that hijacks social media and targets thousands with a
click of a button. But a closer look at the evidence reveals glaring
holes. What we have, in fact, is a grab-bag of possibly interesting
leads and great leaps of extrapolation held together by ‘confirmation
bias’. The failures in this reporting—despite best intentions—point to a
critical, underlying problem with Indian journalism today. It’s a
20-minute read.</p>
<hr />
<p>“Did you read the ‘Tek Fog’ story?” a friend texted me on the evening
of January 6. “It’s insane. Looks like the BJP has hacked all of social
media.”</p>
<p>I did. It was electrifying. A <a
href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/1.html">two-year-long investigation
by The Wire</a> found that India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has
access to a secret app called ‘Tek Fog’ that automates hate: it can
create and delete social media accounts on the fly, compromise WhatsApp
to send unauthorised messages, hijack online conversations, use a vast
citizen database for targeted harassment, and more. Two private tech
companies were complicit in enabling this operation.</p>
<p>The investigation was based on information shared by a whistleblower
followed by open-source investigative techniques to conduct an extensive
forensic analysis.</p>
<p>Twitterati were outraged and politicians noticed. TMC Rajya Sabha MP
<a
href="https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/derek-obrien-says-tek-fog-app-can-jeopardise-national-security-2693721">Derek
O’Brien said the use of Tek Fog</a> “has serious ramifications and could
jeopardise national security.” A parliamentary panel headed by Congress
leader Anand Sharma has <a
href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/parliamentary-panel-asks-home-secretary-to-respond-on-tek-fog-app/article38258217.ece">sought
a response on Tek Fog</a> from the Home Ministry.</p>
<p>NDTV’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZVSImx585A">Ravish
Kumar amplified the findings</a> of <em>The Wire</em> on national
television. “Just press one button and thousands of accounts will start
posting fake hashtags or retweet other hashtags and replies start
coming,” he told his millions of loyal viewers.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/ravish.png" /></p>
<p>I read the story, and then I read it again, and again, and I was
baffled. I have covered <a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/india-misinformation-election-fake-news/586123/">online
propaganda</a> and reported on <a
href="https://www.huffpost.com/archive/in/entry/how-modi-shah-turned-a-women-s-rights-ngo-into-a-secret-election-propaganda-machine_in_5ca5962ce4b05acba4dc1819">BJP’s
organised disinformation machinery</a>. And yet, I remained uneasy and
unconvinced. The story had glaring holes.</p>
<p>I called my friends to see if I was missing something and learnt that
most readers could not understand the story.</p>
<p>“I have literally no idea what is going on [in the story] and I’m
allegedly a tech reporter,” one journalist said. “I don’t understand a
lot of technology,” another friend said. “I thought maybe I don’t know
enough.”</p>
<p>Some part of this general bemusement is understandable. The story is
written by two technology researchers — <a
href="https://twitter.com/KaulAyushman">Ayushman Kaul</a> is an
independent security and intelligence analyst and <a
href="https://twitter.com/onosmosis">Devesh Kumar</a> is an engineer and
data analyst who now does product work at <em>The Wire</em> — and it is
stuffed to the brim with technical language, data and charts, all of
which is difficult for most laypersons to grasp.</p>
<p>But all that jargon also serves to obscure a single unpalatable fact:
There is simply not enough evidence in this reporting to prove its
far-reaching claims.</p>
<p>The three-part series (<a
href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/1.html">one</a>, <a
href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/2.html">two</a>, <a
href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/3.html">three</a>) had the potential
to be a “high-quality investigative tech-journalism” as <a
href="https://twitter.com/neutranino/status/1479035564061966337">one
reporter called it on Twitter</a>. But the proof required is missing in
this pudding, or more accurately, this <em>khichdi</em>.</p>
<p>What we get instead is a grab-bag of possibly interesting leads and
great leaps of extrapolation held together by ‘confirmation bias’. All
it proves is that liberals are all too eager to believe that an
all-powerful BJP has developed powerful technology to destroy democracy
— and merely need assurance that it is indeed so.</p>
<p>I discussed my concerns with other journalists and interviewed the
writers of the Tek Fog article. In an hour-long Zoom call, the two
authors patiently answered my questions. They were honest and
transparent about their methods. They were clear about what they know
and don’t know. They did not invest two years to do a hit job. They have
excellent skills and they believe this is an important problem to
understand.</p>
<p>So what went wrong? I am convinced: <em>The Wire</em> has committed a
classic journalistic sin of overreach.</p>
<p>The publication of this story illustrates the unspoken problem in
Indian journalism. The big media with money and resources shies away
from hard-hitting reporting. Independent outlets like <em>The Wire</em>
emerged to fill that gap. They serve an important role, have the right
intent, and they are not fabulists: they don’t make things up. But good
intentions don’t always make for good journalism.</p>
<p>In today’s edition of <strong>The Interval</strong>, I will explore
three big claims made by <em>The Wire</em> in the ‘Tek Fog’ story and
point you to the evidence they have used to reach their conclusion. Each
one falls apart on closer scrutiny. But you can and should decide for
yourself.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="i.-if-something-is-too-bad-to-be-true-it-probably-is">I. If
something is too bad to be true, it probably is</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the most outlandish claim: Tek Fog allows its users
to “leave no trace behind”. Its users can delete their social media
accounts at a moment’s notice.</p>
<p>Think about what it means. Deactivating or deleting a Facebook
account is irritating. They ask for a reason to quit. They give reasons
to not quit. They ask for a password. Something like that. But <em>The
Wire</em> is saying that BJP can do all of that by clicking one button
in their secret app.</p>
<p>They can also create social media accounts on the fly. They can
activate phone numbers and bypass email and OTP verification. One-click
solution.</p>
<p>This is hard to believe. But look, anything is possible. Maybe their
developers are exploiting an unknown bug.</p>
<p>So how does <em>The Wire </em>make thisclaim?</p>
<p>Have they used the app? No.</p>
<p>Did their source — a  disgruntled employee of BJP IT Cell who
supposedly used the Tek Fog app to spew hate  —  demonstrate the
creation and deletion of accounts? No.</p>
<p>Do they have an explanation of how this might be happening? No.</p>
<p>Then?</p>
<p>Their source sent them screenshots of the app. One lists account
creation and deletion as a feature. Not a single recording of their
phone screen to show <em>The Wire</em> how it works. So all we have is
the static suggestion of a potential functionality.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/create_account.png" /></p>
<p>Despite underlining this capability — “no trace left behind” is
listed as one of Tek Fog’s four “alarming” features — even <em>The
Wire</em> admits it could not independently verify its existence.</p>
<p>So we should believe the BJP has an app that can break the security
measures of  the world’s biggest social media giants to protect their
platforms because of a screenshot of an app that no one at <em>The
Wire</em> has actually used.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/wtf.gif" /></p>
<p>So why make that claim?</p>
<p>I asked the authors to explain: “We added this without verification
for the sake of completeness,” Devesh, who co-wrote the article told me.
 “One of the features we have verified was how a large number of
accounts were tweeting to trend hashtags. If we did not add the part
where the Tek Fog app can create or manage multiple accounts, then a lot
of people would have questioned how they are doing this? How are
thousands of accounts coming on a single app?”</p>
<p>This is circular reasoning. Because <em>The Wire</em> does not have
hard evidence that thousands of accounts were sending out tweets from
this secret app. In fact, as Devesh made it plain to me, Tek Fog is not
just one app: it’s a concept, it’s a “metaworld”. Let me explain.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="ii.-hijacking-twitter-show-dont-tell">II. Hijacking Twitter:
Show, don’t tell!</h2>
<p><em>The Wire</em> claims that the app is used to hijack the
‘trending’ section of Twitter and Facebook. This feature is used to
“amplify right-wing propaganda, exposing this content to a more diverse
audience on the platform, making extremist narratives and political
campaigns appear more popular than they actually are.”</p>
<p>Good news stories provide context. It helps readers understand the
significance of what’s new. <em>The Wire</em> offers none. Here are
three things you should know to make sense of Twitter hijacking claims
(more on that in a bit).</p>
<p><strong>One:</strong> “Automation” in itself is no big deal. College
kids make good-for-nothing Twitter bots in every hackathon.
“Auto-retweet” or “auto-reply” are simple features — not bugs or hacks.
Don’t jump off your seats when you hear these terms.</p>
<p><strong>Two:</strong><a
href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/2/21413001/twitter-trends-labels-representative-tweets-conspiracies-misinformation">Twitter
trends suck</a>. They are prone to manipulation. They are fake and
meaningless. We have known this for years.</p>
<p><strong>Three:</strong> BJP is the best in this game. They coordinate
mass Twitter postings through WhatsApp groups. Content is shared on
Google docs. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13259">Hundreds of
nationwide trends</a> were manufactured throughout the 2019 election. No
Tek Fog required.</p>
<h3 id="making-sense-of-tek-fog">Making sense of Tek Fog</h3>
<p>Now consider two questions about Tek Fog within this context.</p>
<p><strong>Q1:</strong> The BJP already has sophisticated online
machinery. What value is Tek Fog adding and how?</p>
<p><strong>Q2:</strong> How big is this TekFog project? Is this an
experiment, an outpost in the vast empire that is the BJP online
machinery or is it “the backbone” of this machinery, as <em>The
Wire</em><a href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/3.html">claims</a>?</p>
<p>Let’s look for the answers in the story.</p>
<p><strong>First question. Why is TekFog a game-changer for BJP’s online
strategy?</strong></p>
<p>According to <em>The Wire</em> investigation, Tek Fog matters because
it makes widespread and vicious trolling as easy as hitting a button.
The app has automated multiple steps — from fetching abusive tweets to
finding targets and posting them — in a centralised platform. One user
can manage thousands of accounts. Mass coordination is not needed: the
app does everything. Everyone should be concerned if this is happening
at scale.</p>
<p>This is possible because the app has an inbuilt database of private
citizens, which it links to a Google sheet with abusive tweets and a
single user can post them using thousands of accounts. That is the
claim.</p>
<p>But the story offers no solid evidence to show this powerful tool
exists.</p>
<p>Look at the proof offered for the claim that the app has personal
data — including physical attributes like skin tone and breast size — of
private citizens which is used for targeted harassment.</p>
<p>How do the authors know this dataset exists? Screenshots.</p>
<p>Screenshots of the database with a few names? No. Screenshots that
merely list groups: “female reporters”, “based on religion” and so
on.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/database.png" /></p>
<p>What is in there? They don’t know.</p>
<p>They have not seen names or details of even one person in this
dataset. Even their key source can’t see the names in the database. Why
is that?</p>
<p>“This layer of abstraction is added to make the app private and not
screw up with the user’s brain,” Devesh told me. “This is good for the
app operator’s mental health so that they don’t get to know if they are
trolling the people they like. Hiding their names makes manipulation
easy.”</p>
<p>Umm, okay. They say this database is “extensive”. So do they know the
total number of people in there? No.</p>
<p>Okay, so what is the content in the Google Sheets? They haven’t seen
it so they don’t know.</p>
<p>They don’t know anything specific about the features that make the
app significant.</p>
<p>Ok, so <em>The Wire </em>acknowledges these problems and did a
large-scale social media analysis to “independently verify” the damning
screenshots.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/data.gif" /></p>
<p>Let’s look at what that analysis yields.</p>
<p><strong>Second question: How big is Tek Fog?</strong></p>
<p>There is one data point in the story that shows the scale of usage.
Here is what the reporters did: A list of 280 of the most retweeted
Indian women journalists was manually and independently selected and
curated by <em>The Wire</em>. To be clear: They came up with this list
themselves–and not based on anything the whistleblower shared. Millions
of replies to these women over a period of four months were parsed.</p>
<p>Their conclusion:  18% of these tweets originated from Tek Fog. Many
of them were abusive.</p>
<p>If this is true, it is big. If we take the replies to women
journalists as a proxy for India’s political Twitter, this analysis
suggests that Tek Fog is single-handedly contributing to one-fifth of
the narrative.</p>
<p>When I first read these claims, I was blown away. What the hell is
Twitter doing? Millions of abusive tweets are originating from one app
and they haven’t blocked it?</p>
<p>But then I wondered why the stories did not include a crucial detail:
the total number of Twitter accounts managed by Tek Fog.</p>
<p>If they identified close to a million tweets originating from the
app, they should at least have the total number and a list of Tekfog’s
accounts.</p>
<p>So how many total Twitter accounts does Tekfog handle–and which ones?
The answer: They don’t know.</p>
<p>So, how did they conclude that 18% of all replies to women reporters
came from accounts managed by Tek Fog if they don’t know which accounts
were managed by Tek Fog? How did they arrive at the 18% number and this
viral bar chart?</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/sv-tweet.png" /></p>
<p>Let’s look at that. All that <em>The Wire</em> had was a list of 32
Twitter accounts provided by their whistleblower — yes, only thirty-two
— and around 100 hashtags that the source said were made to trend using
Tek Fog.</p>
<p>Starting with these two bits of information, the authors mapped out
the size of this operation. But to do that, they made a series of
<em>assumptions</em>–which led them to tag 102,000 Twitter accounts they
believe <em>may be</em> managed by Tek Fog.</p>
<p>So how did they go from 32 Twitter accounts and a hundred hashtags to
102,000 accounts? What accounts did they include? Here are the examples
their reporters offered :</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Accounts that were following or being followed by these 32
accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Accounts that tweeted those 100 hashtags.</p></li>
<li><p>They added a “temporal” filter: “account creation date, posting
patterns and levels of engagement” to identify suspicious (not
human-like) accounts</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The authors told me both of them have done large scale social media
analysis in the past (see <a
href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/operation-carthage-how-a-tunisian-company-conducted-influence-operations-in-african-presidential-elections/">this</a>
and <a
href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/massive-tweet-volumes-complex-hierarchies-coordinated-attacks-hacker-reveals-how-bjp-congress-it-cells-wage-war-on-social-media-7965121.html">this</a>)
and their assumptions are watertight. “We are not looking at just one
dataset. We are looking at the time of the tweet, the content of the
tweet, language similarity, following networks,” Devesh told me.</p>
<p>Researchers can have an hours-long technical debate about these
assumptions. But know what? We don’t need to. Forget the specifics of
their algorithm. Just think intuitively.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that a group of a thousand BJP volunteers who don’t use
TekFog also got the same Google Sheet with tweets for a planned
campaign. We already know such documents circulate among IT cell cadres
and the vast informal network of BJP supporters. And they start tweeting
at the same time at a very high frequency. All of these thousand
accounts, in <em>The Wire’</em>s analysis, could be counted as Tek Fog
accounts. But they could just as easily be bots or humans employed by
the IT cell.</p>
<p>Devesh told me it is unlikely because they won’t exhibit “suspicious”
bot-like behaviour. Okay sure. How about this: a nineteen-year-old
programmer who passionately believes that only Narendra Modi can make
his life better writes a simple bot to tweet out the same content, using
the same hashtags. What about him?</p>
<p>I called Devesh yesterday after they published their third story for
clarification on how they categorise something as ‘Tek Fog’ activity,
and his response stunned me.</p>
<p>“Yes, we thought about that. Let’s say there is another app for
tweeting out content….but if the work [social media manipulation] is the
same, and it is happening in the same network [same hashtags, same
targets], then it can also be counted as Tek Fog.”</p>
<p>“Wait, I am confused. Tek Fog is one app, right” I asked.</p>
<p>Not really, he said. “Tek Fog is basically an assimilation of all the
coding related things that are resulting in social media manipulation,”
Devesh told me.</p>
<p>“So Tek Fog is not one app?” I asked. Here’s what Devesh said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Tek Fog is an app. But it’s different. For example, Facebook is one
app and it’s identity can’t be changed. It doesn’t have different
versions. Everyone has the same version. Tek Fog is not like this. It
has multiple teams. Some teams have Twitter trending features. Some have
tasker features. Some have it by the name of Tek Fog. Others have it
with a different name. This is what the source has told us. We don’t
have a way to verify this. That’s why I am saying if someone is tweeting
from an app, but a different app, then why don’t we consider it Tek Fog
only? That’s my question.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/confused.gif" /></p>
<p>I was so confused by then. “Hmm, I am just trying to understand what
Tek Fog is. So are we talking about a concept here? Like, whatever
different things are happening, its unified version is Tek Fog?” I
asked.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Yeah. It’s a cliche thing to say but it’s like metaworld. It has
different variants which different people are using. We can’t verify
them. What we have verified is one variant of Tek Fog,” Devesh said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Like Omicron versus Delta? Huh? I leave it to you to decipher for
yourself what this means.</p>
<p>All I want to say is this: In my view, the sweeping “metaworld”
assumptions which form the basis of  <em>The Wire’s </em>“independent
verification”  — and is central to their big claim of exposing this
“industrial scale propaganda operation” — don’t make any sense to me.
And I have a tech degree.</p>
<p>So let’s review: <em>The Wire</em> has no evidence that any of the
fancy Tek Fog features exist. It has no evidence that one-click mass
trolling exists. It has no hard evidence that the database of private
citizens with granular details exists. It has no data — only overly
broad assumptions – that points to the scale of its usage.</p>
<p>And yet, we are all talking about a single app called Tek Fog that
has single-handedly subverted “public discourse in the world’s largest
democracy.”</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/tenor.gif" /></p>
<p>I am not saying such an app can’t exist. Does the BJP have the money
to invest resources to build this? Yes. Would they want it? Yes. Would
they use it to harass its critics? Totally. But <em>The Wire</em>’s
story has no hard evidence to prove any of this.</p>

id="iii.-sharechat-extraordinary-claims-require-extraordinary-evidence">III.
ShareChat: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence</h2>
<p>Back in 2018, when I started reporting on technology and politics, I
saw problematic content on ShareChat, India’s largest regional language
social media platform with around 250 million users. I nudged
journalists writing on Facebook misinformation to look at ShareChat and
its competitors.</p>
<p>I wanted someone else to report this story because this company was
born in front of me: the startup’s CEO is my college batchmate and I was
at the hackathon where the three founders started building things
together.</p>
<p>But no one did. The company only got celebratory press coverage. So I
did the story. In November 2018, ShareChat was on the <a
href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-regional-social-media-platforms-spew-fake-news-and-get-away-with-it/story-s8Kc2s4TKfne0ZRlXNuLuM.html">front
page of the Hindustan Times</a>: “Fake news and hate speech thrive on
regional language social media.”</p>
<p>And yet, I was astounded when <em>The Wire</em> called ShareChat a
partner-in-crime in creating this alleged hate machine. Their
investigation offers no such proof. It includes hints of some kind of
connection, but no more.</p>
<p>Again, this needs context. Broadly, there are two types of stories
criticising social media platforms for their content.</p>
<p><strong>1. “Platform is not doing enough”:</strong> Feeds have bad
content and the company is not doing enough to clean it. Bad actors are
exploiting the platform for ends that are not good for society and the
platform doesn’t care. In response, companies will say their critics
don’t understand how content moderation works. Every platform has this
problem and they are doing the best they can. It runs like a script.</p>
<p>This story can be written for and has been written for every social
media platform. The <a
href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/how-regional-social-media-platforms-spew-fake-news-and-get-away-with-it/story-s8Kc2s4TKfne0ZRlXNuLuM.html">ShareChat
story</a> I wrote for the HTis an example.</p>
<p><strong>2. “Active Partner”</strong>: Platform is an active colluder
with a bad actor or its policies are promoting one group over the other.
They are giving them privileged access to technical tools or insidery
insight and data to gain an advantage over rivals.</p>
<p>This one is more serious and goes beyond tech. The <em>Wall Street
Journal</em>’s big break on Facebook last year which revealed that Ankhi
Das, the company’s top public-policy executive had <a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-hate-speech-india-politics-muslim-hindu-modi-zuckerberg-11597423346">opposed
applying hate-speech rules to a BJP politician</a>, is an example. Das
<a
href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-s-top-public-policy-executive-in-india-steps-down-11603807845">stepped
down</a> following the criticism.</p>
<p>The burden of proof is higher in the “active partner” case. This is
why the first set of stories are everywhere and the second set is in
short supply.</p>
<p>So what does <em>The Wire</em> have to say about ShareChat being a
possible partner?</p>
<p><strong>One, financial transaction:</strong> The source — the
whistleblower who supposedly used the Tek Fog app — shared a payslip and
a bank statement where ShareChat’s parent company “Mohalla Tech” showed
up.</p>
<p>A bank statement and payslip sent by them surprisingly listed the
involvement of two private companies, Persistent Systems and Mohalla
Tech Pvt. Ltd. as their ‘employer’ and ‘assigned client’,” respectively.
Money was exchanged between ShareChat and their source. Interesting.</p>
<p>But the source shared it on a condition that it not be made public.
So <em>The Wire</em> gives us no details. No date. No sense of what kind
of amount we are talking about: one hundred rupees or one lakh.</p>
<p>We also don’t know what the term “assigned client” means — and if
this payment was specifically made in connection with TekFog. Nothing.
As readers, we are supposed to just accept the fact that this piece of
paper exists — and that it is authentic, and that it proves something
damning.</p>
<p>The story has no other evidence that money was exchanged. In leading
global newsrooms, an editor would not have allowed any mention of the
bank payment without establishing a direct link between ShareChat and
Tekfog.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/prove-it.gif" /></p>
<p>Now look, I understand that proving financial transactions is hard. I
have dropped stories because I failed to do so. So does <em>The
Wire</em> have anything else to show ShareChat’s direct involvement?</p>
<p>They do.</p>
<p><strong>Second: cyber forensics</strong></p>
<p>They found that a ShareChat URL — “<a
href="http://metabase.sharechat.com/">metabase.sharechat.com</a>” — was
interacting with the server of Tek Fog.</p>
<p>Simply put, it means that some service of ShareChat is interacting
with the Tek Fog app. This matters, according to <em>The Wire</em>,
because Tek Fog is a private app and has no open APIs. To establish a
connection with it and exchange data would require the involvement of
employees working at ShareChat.</p>
<p>The tech nerd in me got excited. They are onto something. No money
trail? No problem. They have a digital trail. That’s a good
strategy.</p>
<p>I would have loved to tell you more about this and explain what this
means but I can’t. Because they <a
href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/1.html">don’t offer</a> any more
information on the significance of this URL. In fact, they also list a
number of URLs of news organisations like Republic World, OpIndia, ABP
News and Dainik Jagran, saying they raise “questions regarding the
complicity of certain digital media outlets.” And then they move on.
That’s it.</p>
<p>I discussed this with the authors. I pointed out that a number of
common software tools like Google Analytics and Zoho also show up in the
same list. So how can they say ShareChat’s name showing up is enough
evidence to suggest its “direct involvement in the Tek Fog
operation”?</p>
<p>Their answer: Because they can’t think of any reason why a ShareChat
URL should be present on that list. I understand. But at least tell us
what exactly it proves?</p>
<p>What is ShareChat doing via this connection with TekFog? Surely, Zoho
(a utility tool), ShareChat (a social media platform) and Dainik Jagran
(a news organisation) are not interacting with TekFog in the exact same
way! <em>The Wire</em> does not have answers to any of these questions.
All they have is a list of URLs.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/details.gif" /></p>
<p>Let’s move on. <em>The Wire</em> also points to data that offers
“further insight” into ShareChat’s “connection to the broader
operation.”</p>
<p><strong>Third: Data Analysis</strong></p>
<p>What do they prove with their large scale data analysis? They prove
that users first post content on ShareChat and then on other platforms
like Facebook and Twitter. Here’s the key claim in <a
href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/1.html">their own words</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“A script that compared the posts made by the accounts on Sharechat
to those made by the same account on Facebook/Twitter was utilised
revealing that 90% of the posts were common across the various
platforms. Further review of the timestamps of these posts highlighted
that these common posts were first uploaded on Sharechat before being
migrated over to Twitter or Facebook.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But this is hardly a smoking gun: it could just be their preferred
sequence of posting. It reads like meaningless data.</p>
<p>The authors told me they did this analysis because their source
mentioned that “the aim of the content being amplified first on
ShareChat is to ensure it first goes viral with the audience of the
target demographic and it is then migrated to other platforms” and they
did this analysis to independently verify that claim.</p>
<p>“We didn’t make up this theory and then found the data to prove it.
We were told that doing this analysis will reveal some patterns,” they
said.</p>
<p>Okay, but all that tells us is that TekFog operators are more focused
on ShareChat’s regional Tier 2/3 audiences, and Twitter’s Tier 1
demographic is secondary. Why is this surprising for any political party
in India?</p>
<p>The next step was to use “various deep learning AI models” to analyse
the tone and emotion of these posts, and 58% fell under the category of
hate speech.</p>
<p>Look, ask any AI researcher: algorithms that require human judgement
and discretion don’t do a good job. There is a reason why AI tools built
by big tech companies to weed out misinformation are not enough and
human content moderators are needed. The bigger irony: most BJP critics
will think the 58% number is far too low. If and when <em>The Wire</em>
releases this data to the public, you can see for yourself.</p>
<p>But let’s assume they are right and review what we’ve learned here:
The operatives share hateful content across social media platforms using
TekFog, and they first do it on ShareChat. How does this establish
ShareChat as an active partner?</p>
<p>When I pushed the authors to explain, they  said:</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/wire-tek-fog/didnt-say.gif" /></p>
<p>Specifically, Devesh clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you read the piece, we are more certain about Persistent Systems,
and we are directly naming them, but for ShareChat, we are going in the
direction that it feels like they are directly involved, but it might be
a possibility that their platform is used by Tek Fog operators to do
this and the company is not aware of this or not taking action. It is
possible that they don’t know this and their platform is being
misused.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What? ShareChat is <a
href="https://thewire.in/tech/explainer-heres-what-the-tek-fog-app-can-do-and-why-you-should-care">clearly
listed</a> as one of the three companies that form “the
corporate-technical nexus behind Tek Fog.”</p>
<p>And it’s not just my “misinterpretation.” While demanding a Supreme
Court intervention on Tek Fog, the <a
href="https://www.newsclick.in/Delhi-Union-Journalists-Denounces-Tek-Fog-Demands-SC-Intervention">Delhi
Union of Journalists wrote that ShareChat</a> was “reportedly
responsible for developing the [Tek Fog] app.”</p>
<p>Is it possible that ShareChat is in bed with the BJP? Yes, anything
is possible. But the job of a reporter is to go out and find the facts
to show the exact nature of that relationship. And then come back and
double-check every bit of information.</p>
<p>The adage in journalism regarding verification is: “If your mother
says she loves you, check it out.”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="iv.-the-only-big-scoop">IV. The only big scoop</h2>
<p>The only thing that matters in the whole Tek Fog investigation is the
“<a href="https://thewire.in/tekfog/en/2.html">WhatsApp hijack</a>”.
That is the only solid scoop <em>The Wire</em> has.</p>
<p>This is what they have uncovered: The TekFog operatives first infect
targeted phones with malware. When their WhatsApp account becomes
inactive for whatever reason, they hijack that account and send out
messages to its contacts.</p>
<p>The whistleblower was able to demonstrate how this works with the
phone of the reporter–whose phone had been hacked back in 2020, and
whose number was already with TekFog. The source even shared a video
capture, but* The Wire *was “unable to independently verify the precise
mechanism through which Tek Fog is able to compromise WhatsApp
accounts.”</p>
<p>This is a massive and frightening breach of user privacy, and
identity theft to boot.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="v.-conclusion">V. Conclusion</h2>
<p>Most tech journalism is bad because reporters don’t care to
understand technology. This was not the case here. The investigation has
holes because even though the authors understand technology, they are
not trained reporters.</p>
<p>A story of this size and significance needs close editorial guidance
and, importantly, tech expertise to ensure that the reporting adhered to
journalistic standards of evidence. In any leading global newsroom, be
it the <em>New York Times</em> or <em>BBC News</em>, the reporters would
also have access to extensive resources and area-specific editorial
talent.  There would simply have been more support for these
reporters.</p>
<p>In India, those who have the deepest pockets have the least appetite
for investigations of this kind. And that is the true tragedy at the
heart of this so-called exposé. <em>The Wire</em> can do far better, but
this is as good as it gets in a country where independent high-quality
journalism is continually scrambling for funding.</p>
<p>This paucity of resources becomes all the more glaring in a story
that centres on technology. Bad actors today use sophisticated and
complex tools that are difficult to detect and hard to prove. Newsrooms
need ever-increasing money and expertise just to keep up. So it isn’t
surprising that we end up with a poorly evidenced and reported
investigation like this.</p>
<p>The final irony: Underfunded independent newsrooms are under constant
pressure to publish big ‘scoops’ to attract and retain support. The
result is a less-than-virtuous cycle that bodes ill for Indian
journalists and journalism.</p>
