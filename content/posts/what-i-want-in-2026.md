I wrote this list for myself. Thinking on page how I want to organise my life right now. What matters to me. Sharing it as is. (It's not advice.)

**1.** I want to try and become a genuinely excellent leader. Which means consistently delivering on organisational outcomes while building and nurturing an incredible team—a team that finds meaning and happiness in the work we do together. 

**2.** I want to push ourselves at [The Whole Truth](https://thewholetruthfoods.com/) (TWT) to continue setting new standards in radical transparency. 

**3.** I want to understand the food industry more deeply. I want to translate that understanding into how we operate at TWT and how we educate consumers about the system.

**4.** I want to actively block time every week to meet prospective hires—both for my team and across TWT. This is high-leverage work I tend to under-prioritise, and I want to make it unavoidable in my calendar.

**5.** I want to work 6 days a week. And then, on Sunday, after 6 fully planned days, I don't plan anything. Can do whatever. Read or write or watch a play or do whatever the fuck. I want to give myself 52 days full of serendipity.

**6.** I want to have 2 full dedicated [Maker Days](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) in the 6 days of work. Where I am fully immersed in creation and writing and imagination and important–but-not-urgent strategic work for TWT. I want to be ruthless in protecting this time.

**7.** I want to plan my days at 80% capacity, so when something urgent comes—and it always does—I'm not firefighting, and I have the bandwidth to engage fully.

**8.** I want to review my week every Saturday. And right then plan the week ahead. Block calendars. And then say no to everything that is not fitting in my finiteness.

**9.** I want to cut off work messages from 8:30pm to 9:30am.

**10.** I want to log every single TODO list item—in that very moment—on my *[Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/)* app. From "send Aadhaar details to AirBnB guy" to "order a stapler" to "visit the TWT factory to research X". Everything, small or big, so my mind is never loaded.

**11.** I want to be fully present in every meeting I attend, and end each one with clear takeaways and action items.

**12.** I want to read for 60 minutes every day before going to bed.

**13.** I want to do personal writing every morning for 90 minutes. 

**14.** I want to publish four long-form essays that I am proud of. I want to make my first attempt at short fiction.

**15.** I want to capture all the ideas my writer brain comes up with—especially the weird ones that appear at odd times.

**16.** I want to listen to 5 songs every week with intention. 

**17.** I want to watch 1 movie every fortnight.

**18.** I want to workout 5 days a week.

**19.** I want to eat better. Of the 21 meals I eat in a week, I want 7 to be salads, 7 just eggs and toast, 5 simple macro-counted protein-rich meals, and 2 whatever I feel like—for joy. In addition, on a daily basis, two scoops of whey, one scoop creatine monohydrate and one cup of fruit. 

**20.** I want to have a well-rested 7 hours of sleep.

**21.** I want to be better groomed. I want a beard trim every four days. I want to decide whether I want my curls—and if the answer is yes, take proper care of them. I want a monthly deep-tissue massage. I want to follow my three-step morning skincare routine.

**22.** I want to make 5 week-long trips to Delhi. To be at home. 

**23.** I want to host my mom really well when she visits me in Mumbai. I want to fully support my sister in whatever she wants to do. I want to keep reassuring my dad that I'm doing well financially. I want to do a small family party for my dad's 60th. I want to take mom for a 3-day vacation on her 60th. I want to ensure all remain healthy. I want to keep communicating with my parents so they worry less about their 32-year-old unmarried son—and that it is not a problem. 

**24.** I want to check in and meet and speak with my close friends—regularly and intentionally. 

**25.** I want to act on attraction without overthinking—taking the risk to ask out, and staying more yes than no to promising dates.

**26.** I want to stop being apologetic when saying no to social meetups, coffee catch-ups, "can we get on a call", and other asks that aren't from my family, close friends, or work colleagues.

**27.** I want to continue holding my boundaries to protect my needs—especially my need for solitude and freedom (of both thought and being). 

**28.** I want to get better at handling relational discomfort—to sit with it longer, have harder conversations, and make small adjustments instead of avoiding friction.

**29.** I want to have some time in the week where I sit and do nothing.

**30.** I want to laugh more.

**31.** I want to redo my bedroom aesthetics, buy artwork, frame artists I admire, and ensure my plants don't die.

**32.** I want to order one experimental coffee from a new roaster every month. 

**33.** I want to fully immerse myself in Paris in my planned two-week trip.

**34.** I want to donate 10% of my annual salary for causes I care about. 

**35.** I want to keep seeing the systems of exploitation that a comfortable life in Bombay makes easy to unsee. I want to witness.  

**36.** I want love to be the central anchor of my life—through attention, care, and presence in the smallest things. I want to push myself to give more, knowing I have far more capacity to love than I acknowledge. And I want to let my guard down enough to receive it, too. Because in a meaningless life where nothing really matters, love is, after all, the point of it all.
