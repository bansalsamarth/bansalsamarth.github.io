I have been working to find a way to think about a way to manage my week in a way that works for the rythym and pace at which I feel nourished in life. This is always a work in progress, but for my current demanding role at TWT, I have found a way to organise my week. Sharing how I think about it and implement it in action. 

I will start with the principles that inform my system. 

FOUNDATIONAL PRICNIPLES

1 - Accepting finiteness. There will always be more to do than I can do. Hence, one needs to choose. Which kind of sucks, but choosing shows what you can't do—and what you can't do reveals the cost. And one has to accept it. Because there is a constraint of nature—time—which we have to just work with. 

asks on time greater than available time. so need to prioritise. acceptin a new commitment means admin overhead. 

we suffer from overly ambitious timelines and poorly managed worloads. and that tales longer to do the work. and extends timelines. the game is to simplify the workday. 

screw the guilt - if you dont have time, you dont have it. if this feeling has consequencxes, so be iut. we dont think rationally about this because this means accepting our limitation. and gives a way to avoid choosing. so the narrative of pushing harder. 

2 - Three Frames for Choosing** - In choosing how to spend my time, I have three frames: one, important vs urgent; two, maker vs manager (or the need to separate deep work from fragmented attention); third, rest as an a pillar of how i want to live my life - which doesnt need justification. 

3 - Need to have a structure and tooling that supports what we understand about how the human find works. Do not trust memory. build external systems. There is working memory and long-term memory. WM can hold around 5 +- 2 things at a time. So need to externalise thoughts. 

System to capture (todos) and a system to time it (calendar) - that is it. 

4 -  I choose on Sunday and know what will get done and what wont - and communicate basis that - making peace with what wont happen before the week starts . new things might come and that’s okay - and so what doesn't get done passes on to the next week - that’s ok - flexible without chaotic 

As I learnt in the book 4000 weeks, a plan is a thought — a present moment statement of intent on how I want to shape my future. current thoughts on how what i want to do and how to deploy it. to have some influence over teh future

that doesn mean future will confirm to my desures

and that is okay. the more our present is devoted to future, the less pleasure is in the present. so the planning means to stop thinking about the future, because the inputs are planned, and now in the moment, fully devote yourself to the doing of what you have parked time for.

TIME ARCHITECTURE

Hard Boundaries

5 - No meetings before 1030 - protect morning workout time - no office meetings before 1130.

6 - Generally avoid meetings before 2 - all this, except Monday which is by design a meeting heavy day starting at 930. Because I know that is how that day is structured, I batch the necessary meetings on Monday - especially the ones where coordination and alignment is needed, which sets the rest of the week for execution.

12 - The imp thing for this system is - I need to have the authority to hold these boundaries - the only exception I make is for my CEO - but even then, I know the ask from me is to be well and do well - so I make my own judgement calls when I tweak and when I say no.

Maker Time Protection

7 - Tuesday and Thursday are all blocked for maker days. And on Sunday, maker tasks go into those blocks.

11 - Maker time - protecting morning focus isn’t just about blocking calendar time, it’s about preserving your highest-energy hours for work that requires peak attention. maker mode during peak cognitive hours

Point is - block time for both modes. makes comms clear. train team to respect maker time. 

ENERGY MANAGEMENT

8 - Time management only matters if you have the energy to use the time well. Which requires energy management. This operates on four main inputs: diet, movement and rest—and being attuned to my body and how it is feeling emotionally, because a big drain in energy comes from the emotional residue of everyday interactions.

Physical foundation (train, eat, sleep) enables everything.

strength train and eat clean and sleep - imp for being active mentally and high energy levels.

long run, so don't exhaust energy with sprints - intentionally add rest - no sprints that deplete you. Rest is intentional, not what happens when you collapse.

rest should not be a means to an end. it doesn't need justification. need the right to be lazy and do nothing. rest for sake of rest.

Rest isn't recovery _from_ work - it's what creates capacity _for_ work. Empty time isn't wasted time. This flips the usual productivity logic where rest is justified by performance. You're saying rest is a pillar, period.

MEETING DISCIPLINE

9 - Meetings are imp. As a manager, meetings are not a problem - it is my job to organise people and make decisions - meetings are a medium though which managerial work is performde. 

my pricniples for meeting

- if it can be a note, it should not be a meeting. 
- find the minimal needed time - standard should be 15 mins or 30 mins block - larger ones when it is about jamming and creative brainstorming or wherever you need people to participate - for info delivery and broad alignement type meetings, dont block beyond 30mins. 

10 - A key input to protect maker time - give team repeated context so anchor poinys are meevr lost - reducing cognitive load for everyone - when people know the “why” and the strategic frame, they don’t need constant check-ins and alignment meetings.

How the org thinks. How I think. And helping them prioritise. Running synthesis and owning up for what can be done and not - and ensuring it is all syncing with org demands. 

ATTENTION MANAGENENT

13 - As for attention, the strategy is intentional obscurity. Because leadership is cognitively demanding - it is not just about what is in my TODO list. Mind has more. Too much information and signal to process. constant input is counter productive - and minds needs break - so need an upper limit on external stimulus. Even if things are "imp" - have to choose to not know them because they are irrelevant to what I am trying to do - and every piece of in is competing for the same cognitive resources - and I dont need ambient awareness for things that dont matter to my life or work, hence not on social media.

no need to know about everything. Okay to not know about US politics or whatever is the latest Modi thing. Or whether Taylor Swift is getting married. Or the Coldplay concert in Mumbai. Structurally ignore everything. Leadership is demanding - and there is SO much in your org you need to process, and care for. And empty time is imp for brain to make connections - so need to have a upper limit on simulation from the world. Don't have to listen to podcast on commute because "time is wasted" - maybe that's the downtime for brain because brain doesn't want to know all the time. Intentionally choose what goes in your head and how.

THE OVERALL FRAME

Broadly speaking - I am optimising for three things - time, which is finite and I have no control. It is just what it is. Then energy - which is that per unit time, how much of my biological capacity (mental and physical) is actually available, or say if my body can show up for the work needed. And third is attention - quality of being present, and be super focused or experience the moment and work at a higher texture. The quality of being fully absorbed in what you're doing - whether that's listening to someone speak (hearing every word, tracking their meaning), writing (mind fully immersed in the material and craft), or any other activity. It's the opposite of fragmentation or distraction. Your full cognitive capacity is directed at the singular thing in front of you. Attention needs to be protected and directed with intention.

This ystem works because I have embraced constraints (finite time, limited energy, scarce attention). I am not trying to overcome them. Most people optimize for doing more; I am  optimizing for doing what matters within fixed limits. The constraints are the clarifying mechanism. And reveals priorities. 

Week is my atomic unit - Not the day, not the quarter - the week. Long enough to do meaningful work, short enough to adjust. This choice of time horizon shapes everything else.

What I havent done and am figuring how to

1 - my weekly cadence just works - but i dont have a solid way to have a vision for the month or quarter - and some things do require that imagination. i dont have a structure that enables it now. a friend is really into bullet journalling and she mentioned how her structure enables this - so i know there are ways - but i dont have that system now

Week works, but longer horizons need structure. Shows the limitation of weekly planning for strategic imagination.

2 - i would like to maintain a DONE list and a Sunday audit of how the week actuallt went. I dont do this with intention. 

3 - I have a 90% capture rate - so things still drop off. I want. to get to 100% caoture in my TODO list. Another friend told me about the GTD system and the five categores - which i liie - but this is not part of my workflow now, so all i do is capture now - i might wnat to try it again for bridhing the remaining 10%

4 - a big part of my job is to find great people and bring them in the org - and keep making myself increasingly redundant. i dont spend enough time on this. on hiring and meeting people. need to. this + finding more ways to coach and share my mental models with team. this again requires intentional time allocation. 

5 - need to add intentional reading time for work related stuff - and call it out as a priority. for building a great company, leaders must kook at the world in diff ways and get ideas. i have reading time, but that is for literature and non-work things, which is in early morning when i am not in work zone. so talking about stuff that diretcly informes my work - and ideally should have at leasy 2-3 hours a week parked just for that. 

6 - Commute sucks. Havent oprimised for it, yet. Is it rest? Transition time? Or just dead space between work and home?
