# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first post on my new blog, built with a custom static site generator written in Python. I wanted something simple, fast, and completely under my control.

## Why Build a Custom Generator?

After years of using various platforms and tools, I decided to build something tailored specifically to my needs:

- **Simplicity**: No database, no complex admin interface
- **Speed**: Fast loading times with static HTML
- **Control**: Complete control over the output and styling
- **Markdown**: Write in markdown, publish as HTML

## Features

This generator includes several features that make writing and publishing easy:

> "The best tools are the ones that get out of your way and let you focus on the content."

### Content Types

- **Blog posts**: Like this one, for regular writing
- **Essays**: For longer-form journalism and analysis
- **Pages**: For static content like an about page

### Development Workflow

The workflow is designed to be as smooth as possible:

1. Write content in markdown
2. Run the build command
3. Deploy the generated HTML

```bash
# Create a new post
python generator.py new post "My New Post"

# Build the site
python generator.py build

# Serve locally (coming soon)
python generator.py serve
```

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add several more features in the coming weeks:

- Auto-regeneration during development
- Better CSS optimization
- RSS feed generation
- Search functionality

Stay tuned for more updates!
