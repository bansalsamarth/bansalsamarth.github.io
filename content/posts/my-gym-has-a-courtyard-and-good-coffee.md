title: My Gym Has a Courtyard (And Good Coffee)

I took a trial class at [The Space](https://www.thespacefitness.in/) on June 10. Honestly, I knew I was extending my subscription even before the class started, because three things happened in the half hour I waited.

First, I was offered coffee. As a borderline coffee snob, I had to ask: "Do you guys serve good coffee?" The horrendous auto-machine brew at my previous gym still haunted me. They confidently said yes, and the coffee was genuinely good. Green flag number one.

Second, I met [Apoorv](https://www.instagram.com/coachapoorv/), who co-founded The Space. His soft-spoken humility was refreshing—no gym bro arrogance, just genuine knowledge shared gently. This matters more than you'd think.

And third, the class itself. [Rakesh](https://www.instagram.com/coachhanume/) was my coach that day, it was an 8:30 class, and no one else showed up, so it became a PT. I loved the programming—instantly strength-focused compared to where I'd been training. 

What struck me even more was how I felt in that environment. There are three spaces to work out at [The Space](https://www.instagram.com/thespace.juhu/), and where my class was is an open space: an open courtyard with fans overhead, trees peeking through, natural light filtering in. After months of enclosed gyms where the walls close in on you, this felt like... freedom? What a vibe.

That was the day I knew: this is a space I possibly want to return to. But let me tell you how I got here, because it wasn't straightforward.

---

I first discovered The Space in May 2024, while exploring options after moving to Mumbai. But out of convenience, I actually settled on Fitness First (FF) instead—a significant upgrade from my Delhi gym, where Cult was seeing deterioration in quality as it scaled.

FF was 2x expensive, but that wasn't my concern because I have an (insanely) generous fitness reimbursement from office—which covered the annual expense and still left enough. FF delivered what I needed: spacious, solid hygiene, functioning machinery, and coaches who would help even if you don't take PT.

For the first three months, life was [good](https://tbthealth.substack.com/p/flawed-and-fit-everything-ive-learned). I was routinely logging reps in Strong app and hitting my PRs. I loved the dance fitness class (just that the Santacruz-Juhu crowd had no match for the energy we infused in Cult Rajouri Garden—that I missed.)

And then, I slipped. My routine went for a toss, I had so much going on at work, which first made me slip a few days in a week and then weeks together. I hated it.

That's when I rediscovered The Space again, but I made another choice instead. I chose a different studio—let's call it X—thinking a change of environment might help me get back on track.

---

X had a great first impression after the trial. I started going three days a week to X, plus 1-2 days at FF, and this felt like me coming back. But it took just a couple of weeks at X that I didn't feel at home.

The programming was so random. I categorically signed up for strength, only to see the workouts didn't lean heavily on that front. There was instructor drama and pushiness to sell me bootcamps, one trainer promoting bullshit fat loss supplements on her IG, and once, after a post-run Boojee breakfast, this guy told me he paid ₹20k a month to one of the coaches for a fat loss plan—which made me go completely bonkers. And no, this didn't include meals—just consultation. Yet this guy had no clue on nutrition when I was talking to him.

This is the classic problem with gyms and studios: customers are vulnerable, confused, and anxious about their bodies, and they trust you. This creates massive information asymmetry. Wherever that exists, someone can exploit it. (At *The Whole Truth*, we're constantly fighting exactly this kind of BS, so I exactly know how this plays out.) But studios are supposed to be different: they sell community alongside fitness, which makes the trust violation feel even worse.

All of this made me feel... these are not my people.

By May-end, my FF membership was up for renewal, and it was time to rethink everything. By now I knew this "show up and do your Push-Pull-Legs routine" wasn't working out, and I either had to get a Personal Trainer or find a group class. This was also when I was so pissed with myself for my irregularity, and the weighing scale confirmed I had really really screwed up.

This hit different because in 2020, I'd taught myself nutrition and went from 87kg to 67kg in seven months. Maintained it for four years. Only to show up in Mumbai to build the future of food and sell protein powder when my own fitness went for a toss. I know... how ironic.

That's when we got a love letter at *The Whole Truth*. We get so many of these, which keeps surprising us, but this one was so special that the team shared it on the WhatsApp group. A twenty-something woman wrote about her transformation journey. She'd been going to her gym 5 days a week for over a year, finally seeing muscle gains, and partly crediting our protein as part of her success. She attached her InBody scan—"the fittest I've ever been"—while raving about how the gym got her there.

(The email then took this delightful turn about her rescue kitten named 'Tom Cruise' who'd been pooping nonstop from roundworm and ended up pooping in our protein sachet box because it was "the perfect size, truly"—but that's another story.)

The gym she was talking about? The Space.

It made our hearts warm. And for me, it was the final nudge to show up at the studio for real this time.

So what really makes The Space different?

**One, the coaches.** There's no one-upmanship happening between them, and all of them seem to have fun being there, and they show up as a team, which says something about the warmth the staff creates. The energy is noticeable. Specifically for Apoorv, who takes the 8:30 on Monday Wednesday Friday, there are two underrated qualities: his warm up on most days is so sharply customised to the specific movements—not just muscles—we'll do that day, a clear sign of expertise. And second, I kid you not, there's not one second of the hour-long class where Apoorv is not fully present in the class. Even Personal Trainers I've hired previously get lost in their phones, or group class instructors lose interest midway.

**Two, the philosophy.** The Space is vocally a studio which says it wants you to be stronger—and their fairly consistent approach to muscle mass (and not just weight loss) is a sign of the kind of space this place is. Turning attention to this requires education. This is slow burn work. It's not intuitive, this is still not the common language, and there's always the easy dream of weight loss to be sold. When [Gigi](https://www.instagram.com/gigi_b.e/)—the other co-founder—told me the story of how they started, and what their goal is, it checked out with what I was experiencing. Both founders are so knowledgeable and yet so grounded, and I genuinely root for them to make this a business success.

**Three, the community.** The single biggest factor for a group class to work is that you need to know this is not a competition—all are at different fitness levels, and all are there to get better at their baseline, and no one is judging how much you lift. This partly comes from the sensibility of the people, but also from how the coaches conduct the class, and how you accommodate and make everyone feel at home. The studio does that so well.

In the first two weeks after starting in June, I trained with all coaches at different slots to test it out. I figured the 8:30 slot is what worked for me—because there's a fastest-fingers first competition (LOL) for the 7:15 batch, which I didn't want to engage in. And showing up for 8:30 gave me time for deep reading and writing in the morning, when the world hasn't exerted its demands yet.

It's been three months now. I haven't missed a single day except when traveling, on Mondays (9:30 meeting at work), or rare urgent early morning work. I've showed up at The Space even when Mumbai monsoons offer you a good reason to skip, because my day starts well if I visit the studio—and there's hardly been a workout class which left me underwhelmed.

The novelty-seeking monkey inside me is not asking for any change, because the hit is coming from genuine progress—both on the scale, how my body feels, and the visible growth in my strength.

This is why I love this studio. I now get why that woman wrote us that email.

And of course, I was hundred percent right about the coffee. The studio just opened a coffee shop two weeks ago, with an actual barista, and you can pay and get a solid Americano before your workout. Some spaces just get it—from the coffee to the coaching to the courtyard that lets you breathe.

But honestly, they had me at good coffee.
