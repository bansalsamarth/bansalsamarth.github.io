title: I Spent My Twenties Betting on Craft. Not Cash.

I didn't create any wealth in my twenties. I possibly made poor financial choices. But all of that was intentional—and I just want to share how I thought about money in my twenties for buying creative freedom.

For starters, in case there is any misconception, journalism doesn't pay well. We lose so much talent because this profession sucks at pay. Even the best of newsrooms are *kanjoos* at best and exploitative at worst. A few do really well, but that few is so few to not generalise.

I'm pretty sure I was the highest-paid 21-year-old journalist in India by a mile. Because I went to IIT Kanpur and my editor made a case for my skills. And then I made almost the same amount (inflation adjusted) for the next seven years. To give the financial delta, at 28, my friend at BCG who studied with me at IITK made 8x what I did.

This is not a sob post. Neither is this a post on righteous sacrifice to pursue journalism. Perhaps what I did in my twenties is a textbook case of financial irresponsibility. I don't know. But I want to share what I did. And why I wouldn't change a single decision.

**#1: I chose this.**

I went to IIT with the dream of starting a tech company, and I did everything I could to get really good at writing code and understanding the world. I was mostly delusional—but just the right amount to catch the startup bug. I worked for a startup and built things, only to realise my pull for journalism was stronger. So I plunged. And never looked back.

When you make that choice—consciously, with full awareness of leaving cash behind—you don't burden yourself with comparisons. I've always felt happy for my IIT friends who've done really well financially.

**#2: Wealth? What wealth?**

I didn't create any wealth in my twenties. This isn't even a conversation in most journo circles. You are happy to get finances going—not much about what happens in far future.

Which is why I've always felt that the greatest privilege of my life is having a family house in Delhi. As much as I imagined myself living next to Khan Market (and not in NW Delhi), as a journalist, I know what a blessing it is to never worry about rent.

An elite degree, a family house, an upper-middle-class background—yes, middle class enough to still bargain with the *sabziwala* and do cheap tricks to get discounts, and rich enough to travel abroad. You get the drift. It's massive privilege. 

I remind myself of that often. It's an insane insurance policy. It meant I never had to imagine or save for a house. I have no interest in cars. My biggest spends today are on books—I don't check prices for ones I really want—and on health. Which is opex, not capex.

---

**#3: This opex mindset.**

This mindset is liberating. When I went freelance at 25, I worked backwards: what's the amount of money that'll fulfil all my needs (and most wants)?

I did the math and fuck... I realised that while that number wasn't exactly low, it wasn't too high either. Just enough my journo income could sustain it. 

This realisation freed me up. Which is why I did my best writing for free. On my blog. On my newsletter. For small publications. 

Again, bullshit financially, but how the fuck do I make money when I can't find publications who want to publish what I want to write and won't pay? And oh, when you do find one, you spend more than a month on a piece and get paid 25k. That was our worth? So fuck you!

So I cross-subsidised. I'd first hit my bucket of needs—based on my definition of "enough"—then go creatively free. In the middle of this, occasional coding gigs funded the freedom. And one generous grant came through my way. Once I got on this, things happened and kept me afloat.

And I did this for years. Doubled down on my craft. Because once the bucket was full, once needs were met, I was free to write for free. And write I did.

**#4: Going rogue.** 

Because I didn't have to justify the financial viability of my journalistic ideas to anyone, I could go rogue. I ran career experiments without any outcome attached.

I left Delhi and lived in Landour for three years. My living expenses crashed. I had the pride of renting my own cottage. I was financially independent and deeply content. 

I wrote about health and bureaucracy and law and tech and policy and food and media and dating well... anything that I wanted to. I experimented with forms. So much of this just required creative vulnerability to attempt and throw something out in the world—do you know the anxiety it comes with?—but the more I did it, the more I got used to that rhythm, and the more things started working, the more this low-stakes risk-taking started feeling amazing and worthwhile, until it became an upward-trending cycle (from my lens) which I didn't know it would become.

In short, the enoughness of my model which denied me luxury goods bought me the luxury to write freely.

---

**#5: FOMO-proof by design.** 

I hadn't yet tasted what a really high income meant, or what it enabled, so I didn't feel the FOMO of what money could buy. And now that I do make fairly more money, I make sure my new "moneyed" habits are understood by my brain as transient luxuries. When I return to full-time journalism (and I will), I can easily handle a >50% cut. 

Because that is all I need.

**#6: The personal finance scam.**

I have often felt—and yes, this is a feeling, not a journalist speaking facts—that the world of personal finance and ideas on how to be is scammy. I haven't understood why it is assumed that we have to progressively make more money every year (beyond keeping up for inflation)? Yes it makes sense if life context and needs have changed. But what if context hasn't changed? Why keep climbing? For what?

I just ensure I have the right calibration of my "enough" number with some margin of error. Put a percentage in Index Funds, get health/life insurance, and done. 

Beyond that, I just couldn't keep up with financial optimisation—be it through saving money via a dozen credit cards or the right investment schemes or whatever else smart people do. I basically suck at that, because there are so many other things I don't want to suck at which eat away my time and attention.

**#7: Betting on craft. Not cash.**

As I write this, I am obsessing over _The Godfather_, which I saw for the first time last month. Francis Ford Coppola was broke in his early thirties, and then ended up making... _The Godfather_. Give me a break. I would die to even do one thing in my entire life which is as artistically genius as that cinematic beauty. That's the game I want to play.

And looking back, I realise I was essentially betting on myself—that I will make things work as they come. In action, that meant deep devotion to my craft, building relationships, doing my work with integrity and earning trust, and really deeply caring for what I do.

I am—and was—fully aware of the tail risks of this model. This wasn't naive optimism. The conviction of choosing means leaving something consciously on the table, and that forces you to do the right thing for your conviction. 

Fuck careerism. I have decades of creative runway lying ahead of me with so many possibilities.

---

This is me at 31. The joy of not inflating income in my twenties meant that the surface area of imaginative possibility stayed vast. I never shrunk my decisions into "what can I afford?" or "what will pay?" That was my way of permissionless exploration. And no extra cash could've made up for it.
