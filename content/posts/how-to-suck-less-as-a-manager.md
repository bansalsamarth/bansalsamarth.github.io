I had absolutely no idea what I was signing up for when I decided to join The Whole Truth Foods to lead its content team.

I hate—and I continue to hate—the word "content". It triggers visceral disgust: capitalism sucking the life out of meaningful things. But at least I knew that word sucked, and I could just ignore what it means in the brand world, and create what needs creation.

What I didn't know was the extreme suckiness of this "Head" thingy.

Because when I became a first-time manager in June 2024, I had spent half a decade actively rejecting everything this role represents: the bulk of my twenties as a freelance journalist-writer, three years in the mountains of Mussoorie, living the life many say they'll live post-retirement. I was the guy who silently smirked at office workers trapped in their hierarchies, who found himself so alienated by careerism—this ladder-climbing, promotion-chasing, appraisal-obsessed world—that I chose intentional solitude over institutional belonging.

None of the worldly incentives could lure me to this world of manufactured anxieties: no interest in wealth creation, no need for external validation—All I wanted was to stay outside, look in, and hang with my harmless idiosyncrasies.

That was me. Then I found myself at TWT, a deeply-loved food startup. Here for the mission and nothing else. We are _genuinely_ trying to build an honest food brand in a messy regulatory ecosystem and a stupidly polluted information environment. To solve a problem I care about with borderline infinite agency—that's what makes me wake up and give everything to build this org. If we deviate from the mission, I'm out. (We won't.)

To serve this mission, I had to accept what the job demanded: managing people. If my inexperience was limiting my impact, I had to learn.

Only to realise I suck at this. I mean... think about it: What happens when someone who rejected authority suddenly has to wield it? When someone who's interrogated power must now hold it responsibly? Crisis of identity.

And if you're about to throw the cliche of "stepping outside your comfort zone" — just stop. I FIND NO JOY IN NOT BEING GOOD AT ANYTHING I DO!

But I stuck through. Because I realised that maybe—just maybe—if I can sit with the discomfort of sucking long enough to suck less, I can move things further than I ever could alone?

This blog is about that discomfort. A messy look at what happens when you leap into management without knowing how deep the water is. One hell of a year. From a boy trying to… suck less at his job.

I. 

Let's talk about this "delegation" thing.

I love making things. Myself. With my hands. With my mind. When I write, words come out of my head and appear on paper. It starts with hours trying to think through things and translating into a raw dump of ideas, and then I can sit and do crafty things with it: tweak the sound of a sentence, play with action verbs, mess around with punctuations for rhythm, identify narrative breaks... and so on. That is what I am used to. It's painful to not be able to write as well as I want to, but I can deal with my limitations because I know I am in it fully.

Management breaks this. Now you don't do your best work. You "enable others to do their best work" or where you "create conditions for great work to happen". (How much I hate these corporate cliches, I can't even.)

This is a script. Which starts by robbing you of what gives you meaning and intellectualising it to say this is a skill of "delegation". Good managers delegate, I was told. Sucky ones hoard their own tasks, as I was.

I often have this feeling that managers who love delegation are probably those who never excelled as makers. Because this transition from doing the work to getting work done is a psychological nightmare: you lose what you hold so closely—the fingerprints over the work you ship. Now, gone.

To be blunt: delegation is grief disguised as growth. Maker-turned-managers are dealing with a loss, but it's such a private, quiet loss that there is no funeral to mourn it.

(Who the f cares... about the "joy" of creation in a world obsessed with outcomes? Well.. I do.)

And in that zone, you spend your days in meetings and giving feedback to your team, and then other teams in the org dependent on your input, and now it's 7pm, you are back in the Metro blazing a Ghazal to feel feelings of not having done any work the whole day.

Only after living through this tension did I finally come to the mental acceptance that managing people _is_ work. Meetings _are_ work. And I can't be a manager if I don't rewire my models to reimagine where my sense of meaningful work comes from.

Through weeks and months of mental and practical iterations, I am now in the headspace where this change has happened. And thanks to the remarkable essay of Paul Graham [*Maker's Schedule, Manager's Schedule*](https://paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), I have found a rhythmic balance between my two selves—making and managing. I don't have to go to extremes of one—I needed to structure my week to block times for meetings and feedback and alignment and have blocks (days) for my making. I can visually see in my calendar my intentionally added making hours, which gives me joy and which is needed for the team to function.

So the meaning loss happened, but I saved it with meaning transformation. There is no need to downplay what that loss means to me, and yet, I can accept it with grace.

II. 

One of the harshest realisations I have had about myself after coming to a workplace is that there's this Michael Corleone in me with very little tolerance for half-measures, for people who don't understand the stakes, for anyone who brings amateur energy to serious business. Anyone who accepts "good enough" grates against something fundamental inside me. 

Because that acceptance is the clearest sign of mediocrity, which is worse than outright failure, because at least failure has honesty to it. I can't stand it, and it activates a brand of cold-don't-fuck-with-me energy inside me.

This lives in my head, but I also have an uncomfortable relationship with holding power over someone else, so I am stuck. In the dualities I live with, I also care deeply about people and I can read people's faces when they show signs of insecurity and anxiety, or the feeling of lack of worthiness when a judgement on work is read as judgement on self, and so the empath in me struggles to navigate my want for standards and the supposed "niceness" to people around me.

Which creates a managerial tension. In the ideal world, I have now "delegated" work and my default assumption is delivery will happen as per my standards. Competent people crave autonomy, give it. Tell them what you expect and then leave for them to figure. I do this, and I think I've done my job.

And then, someone's mom falls sick, someone is having a low week (because heartbreak) and someone is waiting on something they never followed up on. And so something—the thing that's on me to get done—doesn't happen or happens at a standard I can't deal with.

So I'm sitting on my couch at 9:30 p.m.—the time I should be lost in Dostoevsky—wondering: What am I missing? What am I getting wrong here? What the hell am I supposed to do?

Because now you are responsible for team outcomes, so if the work didn't happen, I didn't lead it right. It's so exhausting. It's the worst part of management. You are managing upstream expectations of the org while trying to be a nice manager for your reportees. The niceness or kindness or whatever feels the crushed weight like inside a sandwich.

Either I have not hired the right people, which is my problem. Or I have great people but I am failing to manage them to get the right outcomes.

As a maker, I know exactly how things fall apart when they're not in control, how messy personal realities play spoilsport. I can see that on people's faces and voices. But when exactly do legit concerns start becoming bullshit excuses—or just display of mediocrity—that is a tough one.

I mean… really. So what do you do?

For now, the only thing that comes naturally to me is… trust.

They miss a deadline. "I just didn't get there. I have this idea but it's not landing," they say—and you believe them. They say they had a rough day. Or unwell. Take their word, and move on. Or the work comes in below expectations, and you simply say "this isn't landing and try XYZ" without doubting intent, and first asking myself if there's probably a blocker I can help with.

Doing this day in day out, in the everyday micro-behaviours and micro-decisions, is taxing. Because you have to stop yourself from jumping to conclusions. Which forces me to ask myself: Do I actually trust my team? Or am I just playing along because all the management gyaan says "trust your team"?

Because the truth is, I'm a human being, and I get irritated, and blaming is the easiest route to self-explain the problem. It's much harder to believe the story is more complex. To not judge before a conversation. To not assume bad intent unless there's a pattern. To withhold suspicion when your brain is itching to rage and call bullshit. I had to train myself to do this.

And I really mean "train." I built my own rituals. When I feel off, I let it out—but never in front of my team. I call someone and rant. Or I write through it. I imagine alternate explanations. I story-tell my way out of the frustration. And often, I end up thinking: "Ah, yeah, this could just be that."

And wait, it's not yet over. You have created this image of a "kind manager" in your head (emphasis added because you never really know the team's perception) and then confront the fear—the very real fear—of being taken advantage of: what if you are being played? That's naivety. Not strong leadership. And when this happens, it cracks something personal inside you. It makes you go back to the theories of power and human nature. (And you wonder if it's time to really bring the hidden Michael Corleone out in the open.)

And yet, I have learnt that choosing to trust should stay my default. Because I cannot expect my team to trust me unless I trust them first. It has to start with me. What I say and do shapes a significant part of their everyday life. Because trust doesn't get established unless the person with more power offers it first. It's asymmetrical by design. If I want trust in the room, I have to seed it first. Not just in words, but in actions.

And I've made peace with the risk. I've chosen—consciously—that I'd rather be taken advantage of once than live in suspicion every day. I'd rather trust ten people and be wrong about one who disappointed me, than never give the nine a real chance to surprise me.

And with this acceptance, I told myself, it's not naïveté if it's a choice made with eyes open. It's just… a bet. On people.

This doesn't solve my immediate problem of not being able to deliver the work I am expected to deliver at its highest. This is my constant beef.

For now, I own this as a personal responsibility—of sucking at delivering outcomes. If that makes me a less sucky manager is something I will discover in time, but trusting fellow humans makes me feel better as a fellow human. In how I am everyday, the inherent goodness in people is what I can see and amplify—which is the thing most easily forgotten when deadlines slip or quality drops and trust drops.

And so I try. Every day. And trust. On purpose.

III. 

I want to continue and talk more about the emotional labour that management demands.

No one tells you how heavy some conversations are until you're the one who has to walk into the room and say some version of, "We can't work together anymore."

You'll practice. You'll try to find the tone that lands softly but clearly. And then you'll have to sit across from someone, their face holding a zillion emotions at once, and you'll scream inside: Why am I the one who has to do this?

And amid this dissonance, you have to tell yourself… bhai, you have to because this is your job. It's so exhausting to sit with someone's disappointment, or confusion, or grief, even when you are so clear that letting go is the right thing to do.

Add to these "feedback conversations" and "performance reviews" and "appraisal chats" with this harsh thing of giving living human beings a number at end of the year to decide their increment... I sometimes wonder if people inside this system realise the inhumanness of the structures we have created which run as if this is how things are supposed to be? 

I have never been—and refuse—to have this thing done to me. I just can't participate in this vulgar corporate dance. So I refused to be have this rating chat by my manager (who is CEO, so he can do whatever he wishes for his weiro reportees like myself). 

But you have to do this as a manager. And when you are doing it, and you go with the intent to show them the mirror, but you can read the accusation on their face: "are you doing this HR type of talk to me to justify an outcome I would not appreciate"… which you don't want, so you roleplay the confident well-prepped manager while winging it through.

Who tells you about this when you take up this role???

And oh.. there's a thing that needs to be done over the weekend. But you don't want to ask because you have told them to relax on weekends and so you're trying to protect boundaries. But this needs doing. So you stand still, and you hope they volunteer, not because you forced them, but because you want them to feel the stakes like you do. And you wait. Maybe someone would. Maybe they don't. And you carry that quiet tension in your body.

And then there's me. My bad moods. When I am feeling low. The days when I don't feel like working. When I'm fucking stressed out and all I want to do is type on the team group: 'You know what guys? I don't know anything about this either. I'm just trying to not suck.'

Or when my personal life is on fire. And I have to walk into a meeting pretending everything is okay after an emotionally draining call at home because that's what the role demands.

Because the more you find yourself in this situation, the more you learn that management is not just a job but it is an ethical responsibility. Management is power. And as a journalist whose work centred around unsealing the invisibility of power in everyday life, I am here now, feeling the weight of exactly the thing I never wanted.

This is hard. And it is not obvious until you do it. Leadership, no matter how human you try to make it, eventually confronts you with trade-offs: between what you want to say and what you have to. Between wanting to care for people and wanting to deliver on organisational outcomes, because people matter, and work matters, and it's your job to ensure both stay in sync.

I know this might sound just another privileged man complaining about a non-problem problem (we do that, yes, and we can't help it) but this is not a rant. It's just that I never knew that being a manager meant is not about a machine-like task allocation or a TED-talk like inspo coach. It entails all the beauty and messiness any human relationship involves—and you can't escape it, if you want to suck less at this job. Which is the thing I learnt: *this is the job*—and adapting to these new dimension of my emotional life is needed if I want to do good at this. And that starts by acknowledging that yes, there is emotional labour involved and this will be my everyday reality if I have to do this. 

Which is why some days it makes me sit in silence and wonder if I'm strong enough for this. But then morning comes, and I try again.

IV.

There are days—or slots in days—which I have marked for my individual work. Which is really needed for my team to function. I am deep inside the scientific literature of some XYZ thing, immersing myself in the material to get context so I can understand the uncertainty in my head and find a way to communicate this to our consumers.

Or I am deep in the edit of our newsletter where I am not just proofreading—I am thinking narrative, clarity and how it will make my readers feel. Will it lead to a transformation or will it just pass away as info junk?

Or I am just fully zoomed out trying to name unnamed less-articulated problems in the org and figuring strategy. We are growing at such a mad pace that at least I wasn't ready for this massive change in context and responsibilities that come as part of startup leadership. Where every problem is your problem and you can't just look away. 

All of this is happening. I am not doing my IC work because I am thinking "Ah this is what gives me joy so fuck it I will do this"—no, how I wish, but no. It is just a simple thing of _this needs to be done, and right now, only I can do this, so I have to_.

But then I figure that someone in my team needs me because one feedback from my end is pending for them to move forward. Or because I am always—always—involuntarily reading cues from people's gestures and their faces (imagining them as characters in a novel I will write some day), all the stuff they are not speaking out but yet revealing. I can spot the moments of disappointment or "wtf is going on here" face or just someone not finding exciting what I am so thrilled about.

What am I supposed to do? _Both_ matter. If I don't write stuff, work doesn't happen. If my team is low, work doesn't happen. I am just one person, and I am the bottleneck, so yeah... work doesn't happen.

And—the mother of all problems—the work is happening, there is output, but I see the BIG gap between what my function needs to deliver for our org and what we are doing. I walk into the office everyday with a cheery face masking the real feeling of my inability to sort out the exact nature of problems that competent leaders spot and fix and run high-performance high-output teams. Which I can't. Because I am still figuring out how exactly this works.

Tell this to leadership coach types and I will hear that these are all my problems. Why the hell have I loaded myself with so much IC work? Don't I realise I am a fucking manager and I should hire people to do exactly this? Don't I know that the highest leverage of a leader is hiring great people at the right time and then delegate (yes we are back to it)? And if I think so highly of myself that "ah no, I am so good that only I can do this", then there is a massive ego problem that needs to be called out.

So I feel the weight of my dilemmas when reporting to my boss (who doesn't know the microreality of my function which needs me) and the weight of power in my team meetings (who don't know the macro context of all that is going in the org which needs me). It creates this weird tension because I care equally about my org and the living beings who form this org. When it comes to making trade-offs, I am split between the right way to choose.

So I hold all of this inside, and these layers of complications in my head come out in the flattened corporate speak of accountability and deadlines and standards on one side and "we are doing our best in the given constraints" on the other.

Which has led me to acknowledge this to myself: I am an imperfect manager and a so-so leader. I rather just accept it, because I don't have it in me to perform a persona. I can only show up as who I am—say what I can do, and what I can't.

Efficiency might take time—but clarity doesn't have to. And clarity comes from communication—letting people know who I am, what I value, what I expect and what I'm trying to build and how. Making explicit how I like to communicate and what to expect from me. Sharing my mental models of solid storytelling so they can apply that lens in the next feedback session.

This bit I have done, with the belief that clarity is kindness. To treat adults as adults—and let them decide how to navigate the situations once they know where they really are. Hope that it will make things easier.

But doing this—as a principle—requires consistency across touch points. Going in a 1-1 with better prep. If I have not thought about feedback, I won't wing it—I will say feedback will come later. If I know they want clarity on something from me, I will take my time, think through it and tell them. Sometimes these are hard—very hard—conversations, where vagueness is cruelty. Clarity requires work and courage to say what needs to be said. And it is my job to do this work to show up well.

And this is a learnable skill. To make what's implicit absolutely explicit. Because I have slowly discovered that "confrontation" is not a problem. It is not about picking fights or getting angry. It is just facing reality. If someone is not performing, it is my job to say it—and say it fast. Or someone has expectations that just don't work in the org context, and I know anything less will probably lead to disappointment, but I have to bite the bullet and be the unfair guy in the business.

My style of management is one where I want authority and care to co-exist—and the first step is to reframe confrontation (which no one likes) to alignment of standards and expectations.

Which requires learning to tell the truth with compassion. Because anger is easy. Explaining is not. Vague feedback is easy. Getting specific is not. Emotional dump is easy. Clarity is not.

I know there are moments where I slip and my face reveals I am so pissed off "why can't you just understand the situation and why do I have to explain it all". And there are moments where it just clicks. Especially after the 1-on-1s—when people open up, when truth gets room to breathe. And in that opening, you feel it: they trust you enough to speak. And maybe that means something.

It is in those conversations that you realise the practice of management is not a one-time job of declarations and rules. It's a continuous negotiation. Which is why it is a conversation. You have to be at it. They have to be at it. And you can only do it together.

Which made me ask: What if being a manager is not about "dealing" with people or "getting work done from people" or seeing your team as instrumental in getting outcomes, but as fully formed human beings with agency and desires and aspirations and anxieties?

So my single biggest attempt at sucking less is to ask myself: am I ready for fully being in this messy relationship—and find joy in it? Am I okay with accepting that part of holding power means I'll hurt people with it—even when I try not to. And perhaps the only conscientious thing one can do is hold this power more responsibly?

I am still figuring it out. And all I can feel, most days, is gratitude. Because funnily, I feel being a first-time manager is like being a first-time boyfriend—there is such a massive learning curve when you go from being a solo person to add person(s) to your life, and then the other(s) have to be part of my learning curve to know how to inhabit and live inside this relationship. In the gradual process of trying to suck less, there is some cost they have to pay.

---

Sometimes I think being a first-time manager is like being in your first real relationship. You go from the simplicity of managing only yourself to suddenly being responsible for others' experience of their work life. You make mistakes. You hurt people despite good intentions. You learn that impact matters more than intent.

My team has been patient with my learning curve—though they probably don't know how much I notice and appreciate it. They've watched me fumble through feedback, overthink simple decisions, oscillate between too much involvement and not enough. They've been part of my education.

The title of this essay promises to help you "suck less" as a manager. But maybe that's the wrong frame. Maybe the goal isn't to suck less but to stay human while holding power. To remember that management is just another form of relationship—messy, demanding, occasionally beautiful.

I still prefer making to managing. I still feel that small death when I delegate work I'd rather do myself. I still struggle with the gap between the standards in my head and the reality of what we produce.

But I'm learning to find meaning in new places. In watching someone have a breakthrough after good feedback. In seeing the team rhythm improve because I finally got clear about expectations. In knowing that my willingness to have hard conversations creates safety for others to be honest.

The grief of losing my maker identity hasn't gone away—I've just learned to carry it differently. And on good days, I can see what's growing in its place: the ability to multiply impact through others, to create conditions where good work happens even when my hands don't touch it.

That's not nothing. Even if it's not everything I thought I wanted.
