I work at The Whole Truth Foods, a packaged food company. And here's the whole truth: you don't actually need packaged food. Not even the stuff we make and sell.

So why do we exist? Here's the paradox I live with every day, and how I think about the purpose of our work—why we do what we do.

**1. We make protein bars. But you don't need them. You need nutritious snacks.**

I have the TWT protein bar almost every day. Sometimes half before my 8:30am workout, sometimes at 11am when I've skipped breakfast, sometimes at 4pm for that energy slump. And always one in my bag when I travel.

But none of this is needed. I could have a banana before workouts, or veggies and hummus in the evening, or sprouts with vegetables, or home-made trail mix for flights.

And yet, I choose our Rs 90 bar every day. Why? Because I genuinely love it—food must bring joy. But also because it solves for convenience in a life where I've chosen not to spend Sunday afternoons meal-prepping. And in the absence of that, gaps appear in my everyday nutrition. These gaps need solutions—that's where packaged food has the reason to exist. 

Now I _could_ restructure my life to avoid packaged food entirely, but I've consciously chosen convenience. It's a trade-off. I outsource this need to a TWT bar—one with ingredients so good that my body loves it. Because I won't feed my body junk in the name of convenience. That's where I draw the line.

Because the real problem with packaged food isn’t that it comes out of a packet—it’s that most of it is made of things that don’t deserve to be called "food". They often have long, synthetic ingredient lists that mimic food but aren’t food. We solved for that with the simplest food philosophy there is: good food is made of good ingredients, and good ingredients aren’t made in a chemistry lab. That’s it.

In short, you lose nothing in your life if you don't eat our bar. I don't even want to sell it to you if you don't need us. But if you've made trade-offs in your life that lead you to packaged food, we will make the cleanest and tastiest thing you can have. 

And if you see that value, you will pay for it. That payment is the signal—to us and the market—that this is _real_ value creation. Which incentivises us to do more of this in other categories. And that's how the self-serving logic of capitalism works.

**2. We make whey protein powder. But you don't need whey. You need protein.**

Depending on your body and needs, you need anywhere from 0.8g protein per kg of body weight to 2g/kg. (If you're 70kg and moderately active, that's 56-140g daily—harder than it sounds for vegetarians.)

As a vegetarian myself, when I do my protein math, I do see ways in which I can actually get all my protein needs without whey. It's hard when I'm trying to consciously add more muscle, but for maintenance phases, it's doable.

In a world where I had an insanely good cook who can make me food exactly how I want it, with the right portions and macros, I could hit my protein goals every day without whey. But I don't have that luxury.

Now I _could_ become that cook myself—spend an hour each day planning and preparing perfectly portioned meals. Or I could hire someone for that. But I've chosen not to. Again, trade-off.

This is where whey comes in handy—to help me conveniently fill the protein gap created by that trade-off. And no, I am not being lazy: I eat protein in almost every meal, and yet there’s a gap—one that persists despite conscious effort.

So my need for whey comes from a real nutritional gap, not from the manufactured trend of protein-washing everything. (Please, for lord's sake, say fuck you to Protein Water!)

The real problem is that the supplement industry runs on broken incentives. I’ve never fully trusted what most brands are selling, and for the longest time, I wasn’t even sure if whey solved a real problem for me. It became a conflicted relationship: something I thought I needed, but never felt entirely comfortable with.

And then... need met awareness, and both met TWT. Once we understood why people hesitate to have whey—and yes, we were also those *people*—we built the cleanest version of whey possible. We sourced the highest-quality whey, made it in the safest facility, tested it rigorously, and now showing all of this transparently.

So if you, like me, have made the trade-off that leads you to whey, our powder is our attempt to bring you the best. And give you all the information you need to make an informed choice.

If you’re perfectly fine with artificial sweeteners, caking agents, and synthetic red-velvet flavours in your daily shake, please buy our competitor. Because for your context, they offer better value. But if you value real-food ingredients, choose us. If not, don’t.

**3. We make dark chocolate. But you don't need that for your health. You need a nutritious sweet treat.**

Our chocolate is my favourite product of everything we make. And I am so proud of it. I have three squares every day, often after dinner, or one small square with my coffee, because it is one of the sources of sweet joy I look forward to every day.

But again, you do not need chocolate. There are so many other sources of dessert. You could have fruit, or fruit-based desserts, or even make ice cream at home, or simply choose not to have anything sweet. But most of us have chosen to keep sweetness as part of our daily joy, and most of us can't make sweet treats, especially chocolate.

The industry has polluted the narrative by making all sweetness the enemy, when the real problem is too much sugar, hidden sugar, and refined sugar. Packaged food brands made this seem inevitable, and in doing so, turned sweet treats into something to feel guilty about. But it shouldn’t be that way. Convenience may mean letting go of some ideals, but it shouldn’t mean compromising on how we nourish our bodies.

If your choices lead you to a sweet treat from a packet, we'll give you a genuinely good one—a date-sweetened chocolate that’s super tasty. And no, it’s not “date-sweetened” because it sounds healthy. It takes a mad level of effort to make it: conching machines that run 10x longer to smoothen the mix, and a cold-chain that keeps it stable till it reaches your home. Purpose takes pain. And you take pain only when the purpose is felt, not manufactured.

All of this is to say: there’s a world in which TWT shouldn’t exist—a world where everyone has the time, resources, and inclination to make whole food from scratch. But we don’t live in that world. Most of us have made trade-offs that mean we won’t. And so TWT has a right to exist—and that gives me meaning when I show up to work every day.

And there’s no virtue here. You don’t need the top leadership at TWT to be righteous for this to work. Humans are fallible. What keeps us honest isn’t moral purity. It’s simply the market. 

Because honesty is good for business. And we have six years of data to prove it. The moment we stop being honest (we won’t), trust erodes, the brand decays, and the whole thing collapses.

So we give you all the information you need to decide whether you even need us. That’s what built trust from day zero—and that trust, in turn, built the business.

The tricky bit—and the underappreciated one—is that this commitment means letting go of some consumers who don’t align. Who look at our bar and say: “Gosh, this bar has 250 calories, that’s too much for 12g protein, so I’m not having it.” Every time someone tells me that, I say: totally cool. Love that you make such conscious choices about what you eat.

Same with dates and sugar. If you’re someone who thinks dates are no better than refined sugar, my first urge is to share the facts and explain our thinking. But if you interpret them differently, that’s fine too—my job is to give you the information to make a choice, even if that means you walk away.

And that’s my barometer of transparency for TWT: are we offering enough information for some people to consciously reject us? If not, we’re not building a truly transparent brand—we are just spitting shallow words to "perform" transparency. And performance doesn’t build a generational brand. Real transparency does.

What I’ve learnt building TWT is that when you treat consumers with genuine care and respect for their agency, it shows. And when you don’t, that shows too. Because eventually, at some point in the chain, the facade will crack, and scale will amplify the chaos, and all the wow-ness will decay into business death. The logic of capitalism has rewarded our honesty, and we have to stay with it for that logic to survive—not for the virtuous selves of any individual leaders.

I say this with full awareness that most consumers aren’t thinking deeply about their needs (how I wish they would). Often, they look for trusted brands as cognitive shortcuts—because life can get hard, and they’re busy, with no bandwidth to make every small decision with rigour. So they place trust in us to do the right thing. 

That’s where responsibility towards consumers stops being just a business choice and becomes a matter of values. And that sense of responsibility is the soul partner of the capitalistic logic that makes this magic work.

The more I understand how simple TWT’s fundamentals are, the more I feel one of our primary jobs is to keep drilling this idea into every corner of the org—to repeat in every room, again and again, what our why is, how we think about food, and the hard trade-offs consumers make to buy from us. And never take it for granted.

As we scale, maybe what we really need is to stay put. And stand still.
