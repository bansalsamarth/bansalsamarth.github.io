<p><em>This story was originally published in my fortnightly deep-dive
newsletter, <strong>The Interval</strong>. You can read more about it <a
href="./welcome-to-the-interval.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Brief:</strong> Is the Indian media broken beyond repair? Or
is it thriving as feisty regional and independent outlets report truth
to power? The answer lies not in the specifics but the larger systems.
The answer is also complicated, not even remotely captured by
tweet-sized debates that often occupy our attention. It’s a 10-minute
read.</p>
<hr />
<p>I often find myself making two contradictory arguments about the
Indian press.</p>
<p><strong>One, it’s decaying:</strong> Both the producers of news
(journalists) and consumers of news (readers and viewers) agree that
Indian media is a terrible mess. I don’t know a single person who does
not complain. Journalists rant the most about everything that is wrong
with their profession: inadequately covered stories; reports that were
killed; articles without context; interviews minus tough questions;
planted scoops; sensational headlines; lack of diversity, and so on. My
diary is littered with frustration. All that the world gets to see is
the journalistic output—which, however egregious, doesn’t capture the
true extent of the rot in the Indian press.</p>
<p><strong>Two, it’s thriving:</strong> There are problems, sure, but
Indian journalism is not dying a slow death—and it is not on a
ventilator—contrary to what one activist-journalist told <a
href="https://twitter.com/amanpour/status/1389289601420992514">an
American news channel</a> last year. Amid a tough political climate,
precarious economic conditions and transformative technological changes,
journalists are, given all the constraints, pushing the bar to do their
jobs. If I have a list of things that frustrate me, I also have a list
of stories that make me envious (“I wish I had reported that story”).
The alarmist ideologues writing obituaries of Indian journalism fail to
draw the line between criticism and cynicism. The singular focus on the
increasing volume of bad information in our public sphere blinds them to
the good work done by reporters and editors that is happening across
mediums and languages.</p>
<p>Can both these views be simultaneously true? How to handle this
cognitive dissonance?</p>
<p>The only way to resolve this paradox, I now realise, is to think
differently, to <a href="https://wtf.tw/ref/meadows.pdf">think in
systems</a>. Take a look.</p>
<p>In his book ‘Why We’re Polarized’, American journalist Ezra Klein
draws on the work of safety expert <a
href="https://www.amazon.in/Drift-into-Failure-Components-Understanding-ebook/dp/B009KOKXKY">Sidney
Dekker</a> to distinguish between two different ways of diagnosing why a
system is failing.</p>
<p><strong>Standard way:</strong> “The most traditional, and the most
common, approach is we see a problem, hunt for the broken part, and try
to replace it. Dekker studies accidents, so his examples are plane
crashes and oil spills, where catastrophe is followed by an obsessive
search for the nut that proved defective, the maintenance check that got
missed, the wing flap that cracked in the cold. But much political
analysis follows this model, too. American politics is broken, and the
problem is money, political correctness, social media, political
consultants, or Mitch McConnell. Fix the part, these analyses promise,
and you fix the whole.”</p>
<p><strong>Systems thinking:</strong> “The reality, Dekker says, is that
complex systems often fail the public even as they’re succeeding by
their own logic. If you discover the screw that failed or the
maintenance shift that was missed, you might think you’ve found the
broken part. But if you miss the way the stock market was rewarding the
company for cutting costs on maintenance, you’ve missed the cause of the
crisis, and failed to prevent its recurrence. Systems thinking, he
writes, is about understanding how accidents can happen when no parts
are broken, or no parts are seen as broken.”</p>
<p>In other words, a system is more than the sum of its parts. Only
looking at the individual elements leads to misguided solutions which
miss the root cause of the problem. To think in systems, we need to look
at each element of the system and its relationships with other elements
and map how all of it comes together to generate the behaviour we are
observing. But while it’s easy to identify elements, it’s hard to
identify relationships.</p>
<p>I haven’t cracked my big systems theory of the Indian media yet (it’s
a work in progress) but one thing is clear: looking at the elements
alone—which includes everyone from media owners to journalists to
citizens—always leads to apocalyptic visions of the Indian press. We
blame specific people and publications for the terrible mess we inhabit.
We look at daily coverage and feel hopeless about the broken system.</p>
<p>But systems thinking says we need to move beyond individual elements
and short-term events and look at relationships and long-term behaviour
to understand the structure of the problem. It complicates matters—but
it also gives me hope.</p>
<p>In today’s edition of <strong>The Interval</strong>, I am sharing an
analysis I did last year to make the “Indian journalism is thriving”
argument. It’s a good starting point to explore the complexity of our
media ecosystem.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="information-production-as-a-collective"><strong>1. Information
production as a collective</strong></h2>
<p>Doomsayers should do a simple thought experiment. Imagine that
India’s mainstream media vanishes. Let’s take the four English national
dailies, the five most-read regional newspapers, and the ten
most-watched TV channels. All gone. Take a moment and think about the
consequences.</p>
<p><strong>Here is my guess:</strong> India will end up in an
unimaginable information vacuum. That’s because the presence of the
much-maligned “mainstream media’’ is unparalleled. The online outlets
(which the cynics believe are the ones doing “real journalism”) don’t
have the resources to hire reporters across India’s vast geography. We
take for granted the stories that fill up the pages of a newspaper. In
isolation, many of these look banal: “who cares, huh?” In aggregate,
that package of information—however flawed—serves as the primary record
of the events of the previous day.</p>
<p>The news reports are far from perfect, and leave much to be desired.
News judgement—what constitutes news and what doesn’t—is almost always
arbitrary and skewed by an editor’s worldview. But the information that
ultimately makes its way through this filtering mechanism matters: if
this body of knowledge doesn’t exist, others won’t have the raw material
that lends itself to further analysis and inquiries.</p>
<p><strong>I say this with experience:</strong> While starting a
two-month-long freelance assignment to report on the pandemic in 2020
for an online publication, my first step was buying e-newspaper
subscriptions of Hindi-language newspapers covering states I was
interested in. Reading those short 300-word dispatches from districts
whose names I had never heard of gave me a window into the
mini-pandemics evolving across India.</p>
<p>They directed me to the information I would have otherwise ignored,
generated questions I would have not asked, and served as the basis for
further investigation.</p>
<p>More recently, as I moved out of Delhi to live in a small hill town,
I had a newfound appreciation for newspapers: they are my only source of
credible information—especially about the coronavirus.</p>
<h3 id="information-production-vs-democratic-accountability">Information
production vs democratic accountability</h3>
<p>The problem is you won’t find newspapers screaming for accountability
when things go wrong. It’s an open secret: the multiple pressure points
influencing the coverage of a large newspaper (or a TV channel) result
in the failure to push the bar on accountability, leading to a shrinking
space for uncomfortable stories.</p>
<p>But it is disingenuous to downplay the importance of 95% of the
reported information or classify it as propaganda because 5% of the
critical information is missing. (I just made up these percentages, but
you get my point!)</p>
<p>The void—the 5%—left by the mainstream outlets is often filled in by
the adversarial press (online portals, for instance). They can dedicate
their limited resources to the missing 5%. This is largely what happens
in practice. The “compliant media” and the “real media” complement each
other.</p>
<p><strong>That’s my framework:</strong> The single most important thing
is for the information to get out. It should not be suppressed. Where it
comes from is secondary.</p>
<p>As much as you may want the front pages of Indian newspapers to look
differently, don’t forget that technological changes have taken away the
media’s monopoly in amplifying information in the public sphere. While
it remains a crucial part of its function, stories that send shivers
down the corridors of government and corporate houses will reach where
it needs to even if it doesn’t find space in the mainstream.</p>
<p>If you adopt my framework—where the health of the media ecosystem is
measured by the collective production of information—a more optimistic
picture will emerge. Journalism will appear as a collective enterprise:
everyone feeds off the work done by others.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-role-of-identity-in-news-consumption"><strong>2. The role of
identity in news consumption</strong></h2>
<p>Most folks won’t accept my framework. My anecdotal observation
rejects the idealistic view that the primary driver for news consumption
is the desire to gain new information and become better-informed
citizens.</p>
<p>The point becomes clearer once you factor in the role of political
identity in news consumption. Andrew Potter, the former Editor in Chief
of the <em>Ottawa Citizen</em>, a Canadian newspaper, made that point in
his <a
href="https://maxpolicy.substack.com/p/issue-45-why-everybody-hates-the">newsletter</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[R]eaders would often call, angry, because we had downplayed (or
ignored, or missed) a story they knew all about from another media
outlet. This baffled me at first. If you already know the story, why are
you angry at us for not covering it? But I soon realized they weren’t
angry because they had been left uninformed, they were angry because we
had, in one way or another, let them down.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Potter quotes the <a
href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/06/why-do-people-hate-the-media-so-much.html">economist
Tyler Cowen</a> to further his argument:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“[T]he feature of media that actually draws viewer interest is how
media stories either raise or lower particular individuals in status…
The status ranking of individuals implied by a particular media source
is never the same as yours, and often not even close.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This explains some of the hatred against the mainstream press.</p>
<p><strong>Go back to my made-up stats:</strong> even if you know that
5% of the information, you are angry that it went missing or did not
make it to the front page of the newspaper.</p>
<p>This leaves us with an irresolvable situation: a newspaper is able to
publish 95% of the information by leaving out that 5%. (I concede right
away that reasonable people can disagree if this is a real cost or
manufactured excuse—but this is my pragmatic assessment at the
moment.)</p>
<p>Readers don’t always appreciate the careful editorial calls
journalists make to ensure that their stories are out—or what it takes
to make sure that hard-hitting stories make it to the publication.
Tweaks range from giving boring headlines and needless balancing to
burying the story in the inside pages.</p>
<p><strong>These decisions boil my blood:</strong> “why can’t we just do
our damn jobs?”</p>
<p>I have looked at editors making these calls with great disdain. But
as years have passed, I understand why these calculations—which I still
find morally unacceptable and frustrating—are made. Most of these
compromises would vanish had the Indian polity allowed the flourishing
of a free press. That environment doesn’t exist.</p>
<p>The difference between organisations comes from the extent to which
they push before giving in. Some show no interest and kill stories; some
surrender too early; few go all the way and fight the good fight; even
fewer just take the risk and publish.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="why-is-the-media-not-covering-this"><strong>3. “Why is the media
not covering this?”</strong></h2>
<p>The 95% math is complicated by another factor: the dynamics of
information distribution. I have lost count of the number of people who
refer to a story and say “why is this not being covered by the
mainstream media”—when, in fact, it has been.</p>
<p>For instance, in early 2019, I received a message in a WhatsApp group
linking to a <em>New York Times</em> story that reported the Indian
government’s proposed rules to give itself the power to suppress
internet content, leading to comparisons with censorship in China. The
young man was agitated that the Indian press ignored such a crucial
piece of information and used that as an example to say the mainstream
media is compromised.</p>
<p>At the time, I was working with the <em>Hindustan Times</em>, and I
wrote the story reporting that development for our paper much earlier
than the NYT. My article, in fact, was a follow up on a scoop by the
<em>Indian Express</em>. That break was all over TV channels for a few
days. But it failed to reach the young man. I politely sent him a link
and requested him to reconsider his assessment.</p>
<p>This is funny and worrying at the same time. I don’t know how this
can be resolved, but I know it feeds mistrust.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="an-example-journalism-during-the-pandemic"><strong>4. An
example: Journalism during the pandemic</strong></h2>
<p>If any of my arguments seem theoretical, look at the pandemic
reportage and decide for yourself. It has shown the stellar work Indian
reporters can produce if they had no constraints. The truth was out
there for everyone to see and the press rose up to the moment to capture
it.</p>
<p><em>Dainik Bhaskar,</em> a Hindi language newspaper that sells five
and a half million copies daily, religiously reported on the tragedy of
the situation. Their reporting on the dead bodies floating on the <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/opinion/india-covid-ganges.html">river
Ganges</a>—their stories resulted from collaborative work by 30
reporters and photojournalists spread along the banks of the
river—remains one of the hallmark stories of the crisis.</p>
<p>The paper, generally perceived to be aligned with the ruling party of
Prime Minister Narendra Modi, fought for transparency and
accountability. “State officials have tried to stop our coverage several
times in the past few days, and have even threatened us with a court
case,” the national editor of the paper told CNN in an <a
href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/05/23/media/modi-india-media-covid-intl-hnk/index.html">interview</a>.
But that did not deter their coverage.</p>
<p>This is not an isolated example: the local newspapers in Modi’s home
state of Gujarat—where, again, the press is considered aligned to his
party—published hard evidence countering the official statistics that
downplayed the extent of the crisis. All of this appeared in the
mainstream press.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-political-economy"><strong>5. The political
economy</strong></h2>
<p>This doesn’t mean this phase will continue. As I have argued
previously, <a
href="__GHOST_URL__/how-interlinked-economic-and-political-forces-create-self-censorship-in-indian-media/">self-censorship</a>
in India is driven by interlinked political and economic forces.
Newsrooms whose business models will crumble if the government pulls
routine advertisements can’t function independently—by design.</p>
<p>And one must factor in the hierarchical structure in which the two
institutions—the media and the government—exist. The coercive powers of
the state offer an asymmetric advantage to the government: if you want
to call it a fight (I don’t like that framing), it is not an equal
fight.</p>
<p>The consequences are real. In a private conversation, a former
editor-in-chief of one of India’s largest English dailies explained the
government’s standard trick to control the press.</p>
<p>Many mainstream media outlets, he told me, are owned by folks who
have business interests in non-media sectors. However careful you are,
it is always possible, he argued, to find some flaws (real or
manufactured) in taxation and accounting. That’s where they hit you when
the reporting starts challenging the government’s preferred narrative.
Income tax raids are unleashed—at the media house, or at the owner’s
non-media businesses. The public will be told that this is a legitimate
act of the state: they violated the law, they are paying the price, that
it has got nothing to do with press freedom. But it’s not that:
selective and targeted action is nothing but political vendetta.</p>
<p>This is a routine affair. On July 22, the offices of <em>Dainik
Bhaskar</em>—the newspaper I had mentioned above—were raided by Indian
tax authorities in at least four locations.</p>
<p>“The raid is outcome of our aggressive reporting, especially during
the second wave of pandemic in April,” the paper’s national editor told
the <em>Washington Post</em>. “Unlike some other media we reported how
people were dying for lack of oxygen and hospital beds.”</p>
<p>This theatrical exercise is not just about one newspaper. It is
orchestrated to send a message to the rest of the press.</p>
<p><strong>This is my core point:</strong> any analysis of the media
must factor in the political economy in which it exists. The
unprecedented chaos during the pandemic—which left little scope for
disseminating propaganda—offered us a counterfactual. It illustrated
that the reason why hard-hitting reporting in the mainstream press is
limited is a direct consequence of India’s political climate. The
journalistic values have not been “sold out” in wholesale.</p>
<p>While this is not a problem exclusive to the Modi government—earlier
governments have been ruthless, too—senior editors I trust tell me it
has become worse under this dispensation.</p>
<hr />
<p>I will write more about Indian media in future issues of <strong>The
Interval</strong>. This is a partial analysis.</p>
<p>The point I want to make is simple: we can’t fix the problems with
the Indian press by simply starting new publications that follow the old
model or replacing people in decision making positions. The system will
continue to fail all good intentions. We need radical rethinking and
restructuring—and not settling for simplistic diagnostics is a good
starting point.</p>
