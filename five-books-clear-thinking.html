<p><em>This story was originally published in my fortnightly deep-dive
newsletter, <strong>The Interval</strong>. You can read more about it <a
href="./welcome-to-the-interval.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p>Sharing five books that are central to <strong>The
Interval’s</strong> theme: clear thinking.</p>
<p>It is hard to recommend books. Few have quasi-universal appeal and
reading tastes vary widely: a mind-blowing book for me can be
mind-numbing for you. In addition, none of the books in the following
list are leisurely reads. So to make it easy, I briefly describe the
reader who I think will find the book useful. I hope that helps.</p>
<hr />
<p><img
src="assets/images/books-clear-thinking/superforecasting.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you have read the work of Daniel Kahneman (<a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11468377-thinking-fast-and-slow">“Thinking
Fast and Slow”</a>) or Nassim Nicholas Taleb (<a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38315.Fooled_by_Randomness">“Fooled
by Randomness”</a> or any other), you should read Philip Tetlock.
Economist <a
href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/philip-e-tetlock/">Tyler
Cowen calls him</a> one of the “greatest social scientists in the world”
but his books have not reached the audience as wide as the other two.
(If you haven’t read either, consider it.)</p>
<p>Tetlock’s research spanning three decades has shown that the <a
href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/05/everybodys-an-expert">average
expert is no better than dart-throwing chimps</a> — meaning, their
predictions were as good as flipping a coin. But the crucial thing is
this: there was a sub-group who did better than chimps and consistently
maintained a good hit rate with predictions. Tetlock calls them
superforecasters and tells us <a
href="https://thecorrespondent.com/493/how-to-become-a-superforecaster/65267876586-9ffafaeb">about
their method</a> in his book <em><a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23995360-superforecasting">Superforecasting</a></em>
co-authored with Dan Garnder.</p>
<p>This one is for those who want a better way to think about the future
and understand why it’s hard. There is a world between “math models are
the best guide to future” and “all forecasting is bunk” which the book
explores. It also offers solid insights on decision making under
uncertainty. Tetlock’s counterintuitive take on the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction">Iraq
WMD intelligence failure</a> and the discussion on <a
href="https://www.obama.org/updates/obl-ten/">Barack Obama’s decision to
raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound</a> gave me a lot to think about.</p>
<p>The book is full of interesting stories and examples that makes it an
easy read.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="assets/images/books-clear-thinking/maxims.jpg" /></p>
<p>I will start with the book’s weakness: writing. It was simple enough
that I finished it in two sittings but it was not a delightful read. An
editor could have helped shape the book better.</p>
<p>But the book is jam-packed with practical ideas about rational
thinking and decision making. Chapters are structured around nineteen
sentence-long nuggets, each of which capture ideas of Harvard professor
Richard Zeckhauser to think about problems from first principles. It has
a bent towards policy but what one learns applies to everyday life
decisions. The author documents case studies from the professor’s former
students to show how these ideas helped them in real-world
decisions.</p>
<p>From the <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/58489701-maxims-for-thinking-analytically">book’s
abstract</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will learn how one colleague saved money on her wedding by
thinking probabilistically, how Richard and his wife Sally made an
agonizing health decision that significantly boosted Sally’s survival
probabilities, and how the prime minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong,
used a maxim he learned from Richard 40 years ago to understand and deal
with COVID-19 in his nation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those new to probabilistic thinking and don’t have a framework to
account for uncertainty, this one is a great primer to get started,
especially because of the wide-ranging examples.</p>
<hr />
<p><img src="assets/images/books-clear-thinking/why.jpg" /></p>
<p>If you have ever said “correlation is not causation” and felt smart,
I highly recommend Judea Pearl’s <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36204378-the-book-of-why">The
Book of Why</a> to start figuring out what causation is if not
correlation. Others better avoid: it’s a dense book diving deep into
statistical and philosophical ideas on the utility of data to understand
cause and effect relationships.</p>
<p>The book falls in the now-popular category of scientists trying to
make their work accessible to a wider audience. Yet, I think that
readers who have consciously struggled to answer the “why” questions —
they are the hardest among <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws">the five W’s and one H</a>
(who, what, when, where, why, how) to be sure about — will find this
book relevant and appreciate it the most.</p>
<p>Pearl says the science of “causal inference” is new which helps us
articulate and answer questions like these (taken from the book’s
introduction):</p>
<ul>
<li>How effective is a given treatment in preventing a disease?</li>
<li>Did the new tax law cause our sales to go up, or was it our
advertising campaign?</li>
<li>What is the healthcare cost attributable to obesity?</li>
<li>Can hiring records prove an employer is guilty of sex
discrimination?</li>
<li>I’m about to quit my job, should I?</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want a rigorous framework to think about these questions, this
book is a good starting point. And if you believe that computational
advances in data science and artificial intelligence will make it easy
to answer causal questions, you should read Pearl — he challenges
that.</p>

<p><img src="assets/images/books-clear-thinking/notes.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am not proud of my memory. I read a lot but forget what I read
after a few months. There are times when I vaguely recall an article or
a book chapter, but it’s tedious to to trace back the source and quote
specific insights.</p>
<p>I used to think it didn’t matter: even if I could not recall, it’s
okay because exposure to those ideas had shaped my thinking and
subconscious storage should filter and process new information. I want
to believe that’s true, but in itself, it was never satisfying. I could
not stop asking myself: what is the point of reading so much if I don’t
remember it? Is more reading leading to more understanding?</p>
<p>Those with similar struggles will find<a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34507927-how-to-take-smart-notes?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=LWMYvZSjCg&amp;rank=1">How
To Take Smart Notes</a> by Sönke Ahrens life-changing — not
exaggerating. It helped me diagnose the root cause of my problem and
triggered a significant change in my everyday information consumption.
The book makes the case for externalising your ideas and thinking on
paper and offers a proven method to do it well. I read the book eighteen
months ago and I still follow the note-taking process it explains.</p>
<p>This book is for those who primarily read for knowledge and
understanding (and not just for information and entertainment.)
Understanding requires active engagement to form ideas and build
associations with stuff you already know. Ahrens note-taking method can
help you make those connections and spark new ideas. I loved it.</p>
<p>You can start <a
href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/how-to-take-smart-notes/">with this
excellent summary</a>.</p>
<p><em>Note: I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> to
implement the “slip-box” he describes in the book.</em></p>
<hr />
<p><img src="assets/images/books-clear-thinking/bs.jpg" /></p>
<p>I can comfortably recommend <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48889983-calling-bullshit">Calling
Bullshit</a> to most people. It’s a fun, entertaining and educational
read with examples everyone can relate with and learn from. Bullshit
packaged with charts and numbers is rampant in the modern media
ecosystem. The authors are concerned about it and their solution is data
literacy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Of course an advertisement is trying to sell you something, but do
you know whether the TED talk you watched last night is also bullshit —
and if so, can you explain why? Can you see the problem with the latest
<em>New York Times</em> or <em>Washington Post</em> article fawning over
some startup’s big data analytics? Can you tell when a clinical trial
reported in the <em>New England Journal</em> or <em>JAMA</em> is
trustworthy, and when it is just a veiled press release for some big
pharma company?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The book aims to help you think critically about data and models. If
you have no background in statistics, this one is perfect — the authors
say why you don’t need statistical training to identify and be immune
against bullshit. You can spot empirical mistakes that numbers people
will tell you is beyond your comprehension without knowing the specifics
of what they do. All you need are better tools to think clearly.</p>
