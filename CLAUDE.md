# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be a personal blog/website project for Samarth. The repository is currently empty and ready for initial setup.

## Development Commands

This section will be updated once the project structure is established. Common commands to look for:

- Build: `npm run build` or similar
- Development server: `npm run dev` or `npm start`
- Testing: `npm test` or `npm run test`
- Linting: `npm run lint`
- Type checking: `npm run typecheck` (if TypeScript)

## Architecture Notes

To be documented as the codebase develops. Key areas to track:

- Framework choice (Next.js, Gatsby, Astro, etc.)
- Content management approach (MDX, CMS, etc.)
- Styling solution (CSS modules, Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
- Deployment strategy

## Getting Started

1. Initializing package.json
2. Installing dependencies
3. Setting up build tooling
4. Creating initial project structure
