food</h1>

<p><em>This story was originally published in my fortnightly deep-dive
newsletter, <strong>The Interval</strong>. You can read more about it <a
href="./welcome-to-the-interval.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> The wildly popular show ‘Shark Tank India’
introduced us to an exciting array of startups promising to deliver
delicious snacks, drinks and desserts that are good for us. But an
assessment of their nutritional charts reveals how food marketeers use
misleading labels to trick consumers. When shopping at the grocery
store, the buyer truly has to beware. It’s a 15-minute read.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sony Entertainment Television brought the global reality show <a
href="https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/shark-tank-india-pitch-perfect-reality-comes-to-indian-tv-121122001422_1.html">Shark
Tank to India</a> in December 2021. Around 200 startups pitched to raise
money from seven angel investors (“sharks”). I enjoyed watching the show
— and I am still enjoying <a
href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/startups/ashneer-grover-aman-gupta-fuel-shark-tank-meme-explosion/articleshow/89329954.cms">the
hilarious show-based memes</a>.</p>
<p>One thing stood out. 33 of the 117 <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shark_Tank_India#Pitches_and_investments_by_sharks">televised
pitches</a> (~28%) were food and beverage companies, mostly selling
packaged food: <a href="https://bluepinefoods.com/">frozen momos</a>, <a
href="https://tagzfoods.com/">potato chips</a>, <a
href="https://www.jainshikanji.in/">lemonade premix</a>, <a
href="https://www.jouleshealth.com/">energy drinks</a>, <a
href="https://www.moonshinemeadery.com/">mead cocktails</a>, <a
href="https://alpino.store/">peanut butter</a>, <a
href="https://greenprotein.co.in/">plant protein</a>, <a
href="https://www.jhajistore.com/">homemade pickles</a>, <a
href="https://www.sweedesi.com/">traditional sweets</a>, <a
href="https://skippi.in/">ice pops</a>, <a
href="https://www.getawhey.in/">ice creams</a>, <a
href="https://nomadfoodproject.com/">bacon jams</a>, <a
href="https://www.indiahempandco.com/">hemp products</a>, <a
href="https://wakaofoods.com/">jackfruit products</a>, <a
href="https://www.instagram.com/namhyafoods/">ayurvedic foods</a>, and
so on.</p>
<p>This is good news. Big Food shapes what we eat. The ten biggest food
companies control 80% of store-bought products globally. So startups
offering alternative and better products can introduce choice and
competition in the seemingly concentrated market.</p>
<p>That’s what Shark Tank pitchers claimed. The nutritional profile of
their products is healthier than the Big Food produce. The packaging
proudly promotes their virtues: “sugar-free”, “preservative-free”,
“all-natural”, “low-fat”, “no-carbs”, “high-protein”, “vegan”,
“keto-friendly”, “plant-based” and so on.</p>
<p>Gosh. It was too much. These pitches had an uncanny resemblance to
the marketing gimmicks mastered by food giants who sell sugar-laden
candies as “healthy bars” just because they have some protein and
vitamins you don’t need.</p>
<p>I learnt to spot these tricks while reporting a <a
href="https://www.livemint.com/news/india/food-warning-labels-are-in-the-deep-freeze-11613403030011.html">packaged
food labelling story for Mint</a>. And having immersed myself in the
confusing and fascinating food and health literature, I feel fairly
comfortable interpreting the nutritional labels on the back of the
pack.</p>
<p>So that’s what I did for Shark Tank India startups. I picked a few
companies, rewatched pitches, explored their products, and read
labels.</p>
<p>What did I find? Some of them are simply following the Big Food
playbook: they are profiting off from what we don’t know about food,
exploiting the public’s anxiety about their diets and confusion around
nutritional information to make ultra-processed junk food look
healthier.</p>
<p><img
src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/hum-bhi-bana-lenge.jpg" /></p>
<p>In today’s edition of <strong>The Interval</strong>, I dive into
three categories of health claims made on Shark Tank India that are
omnipresent in grocery stores. I am using these companies as examples to
illustrate how marketers distort the truth about the food we eat.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Even the most basic questions about food and
health are widely contested and everything we know lasts until a new
conflicting study appears whose findings are uncritically amplified by
the media. It’s a mess. While I want to believe my framework to think
about food is solid and sound enough to cut through the bullshit, I must
acknowledge that food journalism is necessarily interpretative and
skewed towards the writer’s food philosophy and the knowledge base they
are exposed to.</p>
<p><strong>So read what follows as my opinion,</strong> that is, how I
perceive these so-called “healthy” products.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-unholy-trinity-salt-sugar-and-fat"><strong>1. The unholy
trinity: Salt, Sugar and Fat</strong></h2>
<p>‘TagZ’ was the second food startup in Season One of Shark Tank India.
They sell “popped potato chips”.</p>
<p><strong>The pitch:</strong> No Indian should feel the need to eat
fried potato chips. The urban Gen Z snack brand ‘TagZ’ was born to solve
that problem. Their chips are neither fried, nor baked. They are popped:
use high temperature and pressure to reduce 50% fat content in potato
chips.</p>
<p><strong>Target market:</strong> “We are catering to a market that is
not looking for absolute healthy items. It is for those who want freedom
from fried chips but can’t resist. We are making products for them. And
that market size is relatively quite big.”</p>
<p>TagZ got a deal from Ashneer Grover. He invested ₹70 lakhs for 2.75%
equity in the company. Good for them. But I didn’t find their health
claims good enough.</p>
<p><strong>Context first:</strong> There is no scientific definition of
“junk food” but they are generally understood as foods high in
<strong>Salt, Sugar and Fat</strong> — the unholy trinity of the
processed food industry. They thrive on these ingredients. The trio
makes the food tastier, boosts its appeal, induces cravings, and
increases shelf life.</p>
<p>When I compare two products to identify the better one, I look at all
three ingredients.</p>
<p><strong>You will fall for the classic marketing trick if you
don’t:</strong> “Any improvement to the nutritional profile of a product
can in no way diminish its allure, and this had led to one of the
industry’s most devious moves: lowering one bad boy ingredient like fat
while quietly adding more sugar to keep people hooked,” Michael Moss
wrote in his book <em><a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15797397-salt-sugar-fat">Salt
Sugar Fat</a></em>.</p>
<p><strong>So let’s compare TagZ and Lay’s chips</strong>. Look at the
label data.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/table-tagz-lays.png" /></p>
<p><strong>Data Source:</strong> <em>TagZ</em> numbers from the <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220211112017/https://tagzfoods.com/collections/collection-page/products/tagz-cream-onion-divin-pack-of-8">company’s
website</a> and <em>Lay’s</em> numbers from an <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20220211112211/https://www.amazon.in/Lays-American-Style-Cream-Onion/dp/B00PNQYFFM/ref=sr_1_2">Amazon
listing</a>.</p>
<p><strong>What does it tell us?</strong> TagZ does have 50% less fat —
in this case, 58% less fat, to be precise. It’s also lower on calories.
Great.</p>
<p>But the data also reveals what the company doesn’t want you to know:
the sugar and salt content in TagZ chips is significantly higher than
Lay’s product.</p>
<p>In an alternative universe where TagZ was the dominant food brand and
Lay’s was the startup pitching to sharks, Lay’s would have entered the
tank to shout out loud: “75% less sugar”, “30% less salt”.</p>
<p>In other words, to compensate for what the TagZ chips lost after
removing fat — flavour, texture, taste — the company simply increased
sugar and salt (sodium source) and a whole bunch of additives to retain
the allure.</p>
<p>They did what Moss had documented as the standard misleading industry
practice.</p>
<p><img
src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/mai-aapko-sharminda-nahi-karna-chahta-but-it-is-a-joke-1024x672.jpg" /></p>
<p>TagZ is not alone. The “Too Yumm!” baked chips brand promoted by
Virat Kohli did exactly that.</p>
<p>Don’t fall for the <a
href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/mar/11/know-what-you-eat-health-halo">health
halo effect</a>: the “act of overestimating the healthfulness of an item
based on a single claim, such as being low in calories or low in
fat.”</p>
<p><strong>An obvious follow-up question could be this:</strong> they
increased sugar and salt, but what does that mean in absolute terms? Is
there something concerning about the quantity of salt and sugar they
have added?</p>
<p>Yes! Look at the salt data.</p>
<p>Salt is sodium chloride, and sodium content is what’s concerning. In
2003, the British food regulator started a scheme to hold manufacturers
accountable for high salt content and crafted limits on sodium in
packaged food. Their 2017 target for potato crisps was 580mg per
100gm.</p>
<p>In 2016, the George Institute for Global Health <a
href="https://www.georgeinstitute.org/sites/default/files/salt-content-of-processed-foods-in-india-june-16.pdf">studied
thousands of Indian products</a> and benchmarked their salt content
against corresponding salt targets set by the British. 64 products were
potato crisps. 25 had salt data on the label. The average salt content
was 691mg/100gm, ranging from 359mg to 1090mg.</p>
<p>Now TagZ has ~1100mg sodium — meaning, it’s on the far end of that
range, among the worst in the market. In fact, their <a
href="https://tagzfoods.com/collections/collection-page/products/tagz-beer-n-barbeque-pack-of-6">“Beer
N Barbeque”</a> flavour has 1496mg sodium, that is, 2.5 times the
prescribed limit.</p>
<p>Meaning, if salt was the lens of analysis, one can count TagZ
products among the most unhealthy chips.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> “Salt intake in India is estimated
to be more than double the recommended maximum of 2000mg sodium (5g
salt) /day set by the World Health Organisation. High salt intake
increases the risk of developing high blood pressure, the main cause of
strokes and a leading cause of heart attacks and heart failure – the
most common causes of death and disability in the world,” the George
Institute for Global Health <a
href="https://www.georgeinstitute.org/sites/default/files/salt-content-of-processed-foods-in-india-june-16.pdf">report
noted</a>.</p>
<p>I shared this analysis with TagZ. In an emailed response, the company
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have not claimed ourselves to be the healthiest potato chips. We
have mentioned actual facts based on nutrients % differences and
ingredients. The % nutrients are well under RDA limits. We take utmost
care in creating a fine balance to provide taste and better nutrition.
The % reduction in unhealthier nutrient far outweighs the slight higher
amount of others. At the same time, trans fat, saturated fats, proteins
and total calorie count equally matters and are significantly better as
compared to competitor brands.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> In the data I had collected from public
sources (links below the comparison table above), TagZ’s protein content
was lower than Lay’s. The company shared their own comparison data (<a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iT-HxGCRYW8-FhLXD1mA5bu5G9IArBff/view">uploaded
here</a>) which shows otherwise.</em>  </p>
<p><strong>The bottomline:</strong> The industry is hooked on salt,
sugar and fat. This trinity has the power to excite our brains about
eating more food than we should. And grocery stores are stuffed with
such alluring foods. The so-called “diet foods” are just following that
trend.</p>
<p><strong>What I do:</strong> I enjoy chips when I want while being
aware that their chemical composition is <a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/12/books/review/hooked-michael-moss.html">carefully
engineered to make me crave and eat more</a>. I consciously limit my
consumption of ultra-processed foods and don’t keep packs of chips at
home. I prefer that rather than delusionally eating so-called
“healthier” chips which come at 4x the price (a 44gm packet of TagZ
costs Rs 80 / a 52gm packet of Lay’s costs Rs 20).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="sugar-free.-really"><strong>2. Sugar-free. Really?</strong></h2>
<p>Sugar is the primary diet enemy of today’s time. Companies know this
and “sugar-free” and “no added sugar” labels are increasingly visible on
supermarket shelves. Shark Tank India was not different. Here are five
things to set the context.</p>
<p><strong>A. Our body is hard-wired to crave sweets:</strong> It’s
biological. We have special receptors for sweetness in every one of the
mouth’s ten thousand taste buds. All are hooked to the brain’s pleasure
zones. There is also an evolutionary factor: sugar served as a fast
energy source — from fruits, for example — for our hunter-gatherer
ancestors when food sources were limited. Eventually, we started
extracting sugar from natural sources (like sugarcane) and adding it as
an ingredient in our foods.</p>
<p><strong>B. What has changed in the modern food environment is the
omnipresence of this white crystal:</strong> You do expect sugar in ice
creams and cakes. But sugar’s power to induce cravings led food
companies to add it in products that don’t need to be sugary: bread,
breakfast cereal, yoghurts, salad dressings and sauces. Sweetness is
just one reason why sugar is used: it also reduces cost, adds flavour
and texture, and increases shelf life. You are probably consuming more
sugar than you realise. It’s not just about our biology anymore: our
diet is simply oversweetened.</p>
<p><strong>C. The health risks of eating too much sugar are well
established:</strong> it has links to obesity, type-2 diabetes, heart
disease and tooth decay. (While I don’t think we should blame single
ingredients or food items for health issues, it is clear that
overconsumption of sugar is a big contributor to lifestyle
diseases.)</p>
<p><strong>D. Blood glucose, insulin and glycemic index:</strong> Our
obsession with calories for a long time has diverted attention from
other things that matter. Chief among them is food’s impact on our blood
glucose.</p>
<p>Look, all carbs and sugars are not equal. The sugar in an apple and
table sugar you add to sweets are not strictly comparable. While both
will eventually get broken down into glucose, the speed at which the
glucose is released in your bloodstream matters — even if the total
calories are the same.</p>
<p>When you eat an apple — which comes packed with nutrients and fibre —
it takes a while for it to break down and glucose is gently released
into the bloodstream. But pure sugar breaks down instantly: blood
glucose levels rise rapidly followed by an equally fast crash.</p>
<p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> Blood glucose release signals our
pancreas to release insulin, the hormone which tells our cells what to
do with that glucose. Some of it is converted to energy and the excess
is stored as glycogen or fat. The problem occurs with high blood glucose
levels and repeated release of insulin — it can lead to our bodies
becoming numb to insulin levels which ultimately leads to type-2
diabetes. This is why “added sugar” is of more concern than sugar
itself.</p>
<p>The <a
href="https://www.eatright.org/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/what-is-glycemic-index">Glycemic
Index</a> measures how quickly food causes our blood sugar levels to
rise. Foods with lower GI are digested and absorbed slowly, and gently
release glucose, which is good. Higher GI foods are not.</p>
<p><strong>My take:</strong> I am not anti-sugar (<a
href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/the-sugar-wars/508751/">unlike
Gary Taubes</a>). WHO recommends an upper limit of 50gm of sugar in the
daily diet — 25gm is encouraged — and that’s a good standard to follow.
I know it’s hard to count and measure consumption, but my intuition has
become better over time. Label reading has helped. So I carefully
monitor sugar numbers in packaged food and enjoy my occasional sweet
treats. I don’t run away from ladoos and cakes and ice creams, but I
limit the frequency and monitor portions when I do.</p>

explainer on Sugar</a>. Their 24-minute Netflix documentary on Sugar is
also worth your time (<a
href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14914410/">Explained, Season 3,
Episode 1</a>)</p>
<p>Companies are reportedly cutting back on sugars because of these
widespread concerns. But that does not mean they are making their
products less sweet. The “sugar-free” claims made in Shark Tank reflect
the two key industry strategies.</p>
<hr />
<h3
id="strategy-1-use-unknown-ingredients-to-mask-the-true-sugar-content"><strong>Strategy
#1: Use unknown ingredients to mask the true sugar content</strong></h3>
<p>The founders of <a href="https://www.jouleshealth.com/">NOCD
manufactured</a> “a healthier drink for a healthier world” — a <a
href="https://www.redbull.com/in-en/energydrink/red-bull-energy-drink">Red
Bull competitor</a> — with the help of a biotech scientist.</p>
<p>“It has Amino acids. Folic Acid. Biotin. Green Coffee Beans.
Multivitamins,” the company said in its Shark Tank pitch (third
episode).</p>
<p>Is there anything it does not have?</p>
<p>“NOCD doesn’t have any sugar,” they said. “Just 5 calories in the
entire can.”</p>
<p>That’s the claim. Now, look at the label.</p>
<p><strong>Meet the hidden sugars:</strong> One ingredient caught my
attention in NOCD’s ingredient list — <strong>maltodextrin</strong>. You
have probably never heard about it, but it’s the <a
href="https://graphics.wsj.com/food-additives-ingredients/">tenth most
common substance added to processed food</a>.</p>
<p>What’s more? It’s sugar.</p>
<p>Look, “added sugar” is hiding in <a
href="https://sugarscience.ucsf.edu/hidden-in-plain-sight/">74% of
packaged foods</a> but it’s harder to spot given its 60+ alternative
names. Maltodextrin is one of them. (See <a
href="https://thehealthsciencesacademy.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/The-Health-Sciences-Academy_65-Names-Of-Sugar.pdf">this</a>,

and <a
href="https://www.virtahealth.com/blog/names-for-sugar">this</a>.)</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/sugar-alt-names.png" /></p>
<p>Maltodextrin is a white powder — an artificial sugar that is derived
from starch (corn or rice) with a unique chemistry. It is often used in
crisps, cakes and beverages as a filler ingredient to bulk up foods and
increase their shelf life.</p>
<p><strong>More on Maltodextrin:</strong> “It makes salad dressings
thicker, beer richer, and low-fat peanut butter feel like full fat. It
even turns wet things into powders, as when it is mixed with vinegar to
coat potato chips,” Michael Moss explained in his new book, <em><a
href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/246273/hooked-by-michael-moss/">Hooked</a></em>.
The most peculiar thing: “it has the chemical structure of sugar and yet
doesn’t taste sweet. This makes it highly useful to food
manufacturers.”</p>
<p>The problem with maltodextrin is its <a
href="https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/is-maltodextrin-bad-for-me#is-it-safe">high
glycemic index</a>, ranging from 106 to 136. Table sugar’s GI value is
65.</p>
<p><strong>What does this mean?</strong> Maltodextrin’s glucose response
and insulin spike are worse than table sugar.</p>
<p><img
src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/ye-sab-doglapan-hai.jpeg" /></p>
<p>To be sure, this is not to say that just the presence of maltodextrin
makes a product unhealthy — just like the presence of sugar doesn’t make
a product unhealthy.</p>
<p>But we should see maltodextrin for what it is: sugar. So can we say
that NOCD drink has “no added sugar”? Not really.</p>
<p>I emailed a NOCD founder but he didn’t respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p>Do watch out for maltodextrin in the products you buy. <a
href="https://www.bigbasket.com/pd/40052960/horlicks-womens-plus-chocolate-400-g-carton/">Horlick’s
Women’s Plus</a> is another “no added sugar” product stuffed with
maltodextrin.</p>

<h3 id="strategy-2-the-world-of-sugar-substitutes"><strong>Strategy #2:
The world of sugar substitutes</strong></h3>
<p>Consumers want sweet products without the calories of sugar and avoid
problems such as diabetes. Enter sweeteners: ingredients that allow the
industry to claim “sugar-free” labels and yet retain sweetness.</p>
<p>The science of sweeteners is complicated, but step one is to
recognise their existence in the food you eat. They appear in names you
may not have heard, making it harder to know what you are consuming and
what it does in your body.</p>
<p>The sweeteners used by Shark Tank startups show the <strong>three
popular sweetener categories:</strong></p>
<p><img src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/sugar-categories.png" /></p>
<p><strong>A) Sugar alcohols:</strong> They are hybrids of sugar and
alcohol molecules with a chemical structure similar to sugar that
activate taste receptors on your tongue. (You won’t get high because it
lacks ethanol.) Its calorie content and glycemic index is lower than
table sugar. And they don’t destroy your teeth. But it can cause
digestive issues if consumed in large amounts as the body can’t digest
most of them. These sugar alcohols are used as low-calorie sweeteners in
a lot of processed food.</p>
<p>For example, the <a
href="https://twitter.com/sunitarora/status/1403272988963741704">sugar-free
version of Rooh Afza</a> (80% of the original drink is sugar) is
sweetened with Maltitol.</p>
<p><strong>B) Low-calorie artificial sweeteners:</strong> Most of these
were accidentally discovered. Saccharin, which is 300 times sweeter than
table sugar, was among the first ones to appear in 1878. Diet Coke, for
instance, is sweetened with Aspartame which was discovered in the 1960s.
It has roughly the same calories as sugar but it is 200 times more
sweet, meaning we need it in so little amount that its caloric
contribution is negligible.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, consumers were worried that artificial sweeteners cause
cancer. They do not: we now have enough evidence to disprove any link.
That’s not a real problem.</p>
<p><strong>C)Low-calorie natural sweeteners:</strong> Stevia, which is
derived from a South American plant, is the most well-known example. I
am not aware of others. It is 300 times sweeter than sugar but leaves a
bitter aftertaste.</p>
<p>Note that our body’s response to different sweeteners is not the
same. It varies, which is why it is hard to pass blanket judgements.</p>
<p>What do we know so far about the health benefits of the sugar
substitutes that allow companies to slap “sugar-free” labels on their
products?</p>
<p><strong>1. Research results about the consequences of consuming sugar
substitutes are inconsistent.</strong></p>
<p>From <a
href="https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/are-sugar-substitutes-too-sweet-to-be-true-2020050419692">Harvard
Health Blog</a>: “We simply do not have enough data to strongly
recommend avoiding low-calorie sweeteners. We also don’t have enough
evidence to strongly endorse them. Until we have more research, it might
be wise to decrease use of low-calorie sweeteners.”</p>
<p><strong>Why is the research so conflicted?</strong> Professor Tim
Specter’s book <a
href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/49387099-spoon-fed">Spoon-Fed</a>
has a less-known data point: “At least 30 per cent of over 400 or so
studies on artificial sweeteners are funded by the drinks industry, and
although there are exceptions, these studies tend to be of insubstantial
size and are mainly in rodents, adding to confusion.”</p>
<p>He adds: “This undue influence of the drinks industry, and sometimes
entire countries, on researchers and regulators and possibly
journalists, explains why it has taken so long for us to realise that
ASBs’ [artificially sweetened beverages] offer no benefit in weight loss
over regular fizzy drinks or sodas and why no one objects to them still
being called diet drinks.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Doubt is the weapon!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>2. While we don’t have good data, there are two theoretical
criticisms of sweeteners — behavioural and biological:</strong></p>
<p><strong>One, compensation.</strong> From <a
href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/07/5-questions-christopher-gardner-on-non-nutritive-sweeteners.html">Stanford’s
Christopher Gardner</a>: “It’s the idea that if you cut back on calories
during one part of your day, then either psychologically or
physiologically you want to make up for it later in the day. So you may
think to yourself, ‘I saved calories this morning, so I’m going to have
a cookie with lunch.’”</p>
<p><strong>Two, chemical mismatch.</strong> Some worry that sweeteners
can interfere with our metabolic and insulin pathways in ways we don’t
understand.</p>
<p>From <a
href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/13/14219606/sugar-intake-dietary-nutrition-science">Vox</a>:
“The main idea here is that fake sugars may trigger our body’s responses
to real sugar. When we taste something sugary, our body is conditioned
to release hormones like insulin, so that when the sugar and calories
hit our gut, we’re prepared to metabolize them. When you introduce
artificial sweeteners, the body gets ready for sugar, but the sugar then
doesn’t arrive.”</p>
<p>The long-term impact of this mismatch is not clearly understood.</p>
<p><strong>The bottomline:</strong> Sweeteners are not magic bullets and
we should limit intake of both sugars and sweeteners. Nothing comes for
free — so look out for the sweeteners in your “sugar-free” products.
Carefully read nutrition labels to spot hidden sugars and it’s generally
advised to not consume more than a few servings per day of any of these
substances.</p>
<p><strong>Stanford’s Gardner <a
href="https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2012/07/5-questions-christopher-gardner-on-non-nutritive-sweeteners.html">puts
it brilliantly</a>:</strong> “Junk foods that offer a ‘diet’ version
where real sugars are replaced with non-nutritive sweeteners aren’t
transformed into health foods. They are still junk foods with less sugar
and fewer calories — healthier, but not healthy. Go with real foods
rather than diet foods. The two places where you are most likely to find
the non-nutritive sweeteners helpful are with sodas and coffee;
switching from regular soda to diet soda, or using those little pink,
blue or yellow packets of sweeteners instead of sugar in your plain
coffee is likely to help you consume less sugar and fewer calories
overall for the whole day. But water would still be better than the diet
soda, and beware the sugar-free mocha-frappuccino with double-whip.”</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="its-all-natural"><strong>3. It’s all-natural!</strong></h2>
<p>A sharp observation by a shark in the show’s finale week shows how
front-of-pack labels and claims are meaningless.</p>
<p>“What’s so new in this?” Ashneer Grover asked a fermented beverage
startup in the 33rd episode.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Many people are selling different drinks in the market. And this
thing about being fresh and preservative-free — that is given. So many
people have said [their products are] preservative-free here [in the
show] that I have started wondering why the previous companies even
added preservatives. It seems like they added it for fun!” he said, in
Hindi.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ashneer was spot on. While there are some products that genuinely
avoid anything artificial, most just add the “natural” and
“preservative-free” label to make health claims.</p>
<p>Look at the first company which got an all-shark deal — where all
five sharks in the tank invested money. That’s <strong>Skippy Ice
Pops</strong>.</p>
<p>“No Artificial Colours. No Artificial Flavours. No Artificial
Preservatives. No Artificial Sweeteners,” they say on the website. “The
colour and flavour are extracted from actual fruits and vegetables,” the
founders said on the show.</p>
<p>This product’s marketing most clearly reflects the food industry’s
obsession with making bullshit healthy-sounding claims.As one shark
pointed out in the show, what they are selling is, simply, sugar water:
sugar is the key component in their product! Who even thinks about
nutrition while ingesting a sugar candy? The funniest thing is their
last claim: “No Artificial Sweeteners”. Haha.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/natural-comic.png" /></p>
<p>To be sure, the founders acknowledged that they are not marketing the
pops as a health product — it’s a fun product. But their website says
“healthy for all tummies”. Anyway, what matters here is Skippy’s
products use the increasingly abused “natural food” label.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> “Flavours” are ingredients that exist for
taste and not for nutritional value. At its most basic, “natural
flavours” are chemicals extracted from a natural source — a plant or
animal, for example. “Artificial flavours” are the same chemicals
synthesised in a lab. Both can have exactly the same chemical
composition. What is different is the source.</p>
<p>The problem? From the <em><a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/business/natural-food-products.html">New
York Times</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consumers, increasingly wary of products that are overly processed or
full of manufactured chemicals, are paying premium prices for natural
goods, from fruit juices and cereals to shampoos and baby wipes.</p>
<p>But as a spate of lawsuits and consumer advocacy efforts show, one
person’s “natural” is another person’s methylisothiazolinone.</p>
<p>The problem, consumer groups and even some manufacturers say, is that
there is no legal or regulatory definition of what “natural” is.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the reason companies use this label in wholesale is simple:
marketing. Skippy is exploiting this and it was easy to catch their
bluff.</p>
<p>“E150D” is an ingredient in their ice pops, and according to <a
href="https://www.safefood.net/food-colour-index">food additives
databases</a>, it’s not natural. It’s an artificial colour.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/shark-tank-food/e150d.png" /></p>
<p>I emailed the company but they didn’t respond to a request for
comment.</p>
<p><strong>The bottomline:</strong> Yet again, just ignore all the
front-of-pack claims. If you really care about the “natural” vs
“artificial” distinction, read the label. Three experts <a
href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2017/11/03/560048780/is-natural-flavor-healthier-than-artificial-flavor">interviewed
by NPR</a> say it doesn’t really matter, though I avoid it when I
can.</p>
<p><strong>From Professor Tim Specter’s book
<em>Spoon-Fed</em>:</strong> “Many of the multiple added ingredients are
chemicals that alone or in combination are likely to be bad for our
long-term health. We know manufacturers manipulate the flavours to make
us eat much more than we want to, and many of the key chemicals can
interfere with the health of our gut ingredients. This includes
artificial sweeteners, emulsifiers and preservatives. None of these
chemicals are naturally present in the food of any of our ancestors and
our gut microbes and genes or hormones will not have evolved to deal
with them safely. “</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
<p>Look, if you really care about buying healthy food, you need to learn
label reading. It’s not hard — it’s a matter of routine and
practice.</p>
<p>Start with this:</p>
<p>I will end with advice from two Michaels whose writing has shaped my
thinking about food.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Moss</strong>: We need to seize control to ward off
unhealthy dependence on processed food. Do yourself a favour and learn
to read the entire label. Create a better food environment at your home.
Awareness is key so we can see products for what they are. And buy them
consciously without falling for the marketing tricks.</p>
<p><strong><a
href="https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/28/magazine/28nutritionism.t.html">Michael
Pollan</a>:</strong> “If you’re concerned about your health, you should
probably avoid food products that make health claims. Why? Because a
health claim on a food product is a good indication that it’s not really
food, and food is what you want to eat.”</p>
