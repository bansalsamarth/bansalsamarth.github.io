                <h3>What I'm building</h3>
                <p><strong>1) <a href = "https://www.theplankmag.com" target="_blank">The Plank</a></strong> — I'm the founder and editor-in-chief of a new magazine dedicated to truth-seeking journalism for curious citizens. We went live in December 2024. I'm building a sustainable new media institution in India with a razor-sharp focus on journalistic values and offering a platform for emerging and established writers to tell the stories that need to be told. </p>

                <p><strong>2) Media Labs at <a href="https://thewholetruthfoods.com/" target="_blank">The Whole Truth Foods</a></strong> — I lead the media division at a clean-label food startup working to rebuild the world's trust in its food. I'm so proud of the work we do: yes, we are a brand, but we are a borderline moral crusade. We reveal the food industry's hidden truths and expose how Big Food has compromised our health for decades. Through our work, we're learning how an honest food brand built with love and care can thrive through conscious capitalism. (Here's the story of how I ended up at The Whole Truth.)</p>

                <p>My two jobs keep me fully occupied, yet I always make time for my daily joys: a good cup of coffee, reading whatever catches my interest, and romanticising the city of Bombay.</p>

                <p>I grew up in New Delhi and studied mathematics and scientific computing at IIT Kanpur. My journalism career began with reporting roles at <em>The Hindu</em> and <em>Hindustan Times</em>, followed by an investigative journalism fellowship at <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> in New York. I've since written for <em>The Atlantic</em>, <em>Mint</em>, <em>Rest of World</em> and others.</p>
