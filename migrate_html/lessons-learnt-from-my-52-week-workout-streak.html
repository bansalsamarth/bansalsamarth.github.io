          <h1>Lessons learnt from my 52-week workout streak</h1>

    <hr>


<p>Today, I have hit a personal milestone: <a
href="https://www.cult.fit/">cult.fit app</a> informs me I was regular
with my workouts for 52 weeks in a row — meaning, over the last year, I
exercised every single week without exception. From being a high school
student who bunked the sports period to study in the library, I have
come a long way.</p>
<p>Yes, there were bad weeks where my intensity was low or I could pack
in just one session. But they were few in number. I don’t have the exact
stats, but I estimate my hit rate was ~4-5 sessions per week, focused on
strength training and cardio, skewed towards the former. Irrespective of
the metrics, fitness is primarily about being consistent—and I am glad
that my timeline has stretched to one full-year.</p>
<p>Blogging today to document a few thoughts and lessons learnt in this
process:</p>
<p><strong>1. How it started:</strong> My fitness journey began with an
ambitious fat loss goal. I had to maintain a calorie deficit and the
primary point of control was food: you can not out-train a bad diet. But
of course, workouts are absolutely crucial. Two reasons.</p>
<p>First, to burn more calories and increase my daily energy expenditure
(which helps in maintaining deficit). And second, to ensure my weight
loss is driven by fat loss and not muscle loss: strength training is
crucial to optimise for that goal.</p>
<p>And so I did. It took me seven months — July 2020 to January 2021 —
to reach my target of losing 20kgs. (I will blog about my fat loss
journey in great detail in a future post.)</p>
<p>Those seven months completely changed my outlook about workouts: no
more did it feel like a chore, something I had to forcefully do just
because doctors says it’s good. I experienced what regular exercise did
to me: high energy levels through the day, more strength, better mood
and increased capacity to move around. Most importantly: I feel so good
after every session — that in itself makes the effort worth it. It is,
as some people call it, free therapy.</p>
<p><strong>2. Automating my behaviour:</strong> Will power and
motivation are overrated. Follow as many fitness instructors on
Instagram; watch as many YouTube talks explaining why exercise matters;
read any number of books on health; enrol in however expensive fitness
programs — none of that works in the long term if you don’t convert your
motivation to be fitter into a habit operating on auto-pilot. How to do
that?</p>
<p>Here is an excellent idea I learnt from behavioural economist Sendhil
Mullainathan. In an episode of the Knowledge Project podcast, he said:
going to the gym everyday is much easier than going three days a week.
It removes a really difficult hurdle in life: choosing. To install the
habit, just go every day — even on days you are pressed for time. Go and
leave in five minutes. Showing up is the victory, Mullainathan says.
Keeping the bar low and staying consistent is what makes desirable
habits stick.</p>
<p>Mullainathan <a
href="https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/sendhil-mullainathan/">makes the
case for eliminating decisions and following a pre-decided list of
rules</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rule versus decision has another element which I really like,
which is, there’s a person in my life I just do not trust. Even though I
spend a lot of time with this person, I just do not trust them. It’s
embarrassing to say, but I don’t trust their motives, I don’t trust them
to follow through on anything. And that person is me.</p>
<p>You should not trust yourself? So decisions, it’s like handing over
bubblewrap to a five year old. You know what’s going to happen. So rules
versus decisions are in part also the recognition that you have an
uneasy relationship with yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I relate to this so much. Decision making can be especially hard in
the overwhelming world of fitness. As Daniel Lieberman <a
href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/557099/exercised-by-daniel-e-lieberman/">writes
in his book</a>, most people are constantly <em>exercised</em> about
exercise: the commodification, commercialisation and industrialisation
of exercise rarely make it fun. Rampant confusion and doubts only make
things worse. Gyms and coaches make a hell lot of money feeding on
people’s anxieties and insecurities about their bodies. It is easy to
get stuck in a decision paralysis, constantly doubting you are missing
out and not doing the right thing, not enjoying the process and falling
off the track.</p>
<p>If you just simplify what you intend to do and stay committed to it,
you are more likely to stay on course. I was able to do that thanks to
one of my favourite Indian startups: cult.fit. The Bengaluru-based
startup has reduced the friction in accessing fitness: their online
product for at-home workouts was just what I needed to meet my goals.
They make fitness fun: the expansive variety ensures that the workouts
are not monotonous, and I remain excited about what’s coming in the next
session.</p>
<p>Cult reduced the number of decisions I had to make: I only had to
decide what my weekly workout mix needs to look like and then, as a
rule, go to the app and do the session. It’s that simple.</p>
<p><strong>3. A strategy that helped me inculcate exercise in my daily
routine:</strong> doing it first thing in the morning. This works
brilliantly for me. Random things happen as the day progresses: an
unscheduled phone call, an unexpected assignment at work, mood swing and
what not. The result: the 6pm exercise plan falls apart. Mornings are
less random, and the likelihood of meeting your goal is higher.</p>
<p>Morning workouts have two other advantages. One, I feel a sense of
accomplishment, having struck off one task from my todo list early in
the morning. Second, I start my workday with higher energy levels.</p>
<p><strong>4. Finding the time:</strong> I am convinced that being busy
is not a good excuse for missing out on my workouts. If it features on
my priority list, I am able to find time. When I try to bluff myself, I
think about Barack Obama’s routine. In his memoir published last year,
the former President of the United States told us about his workout
schedule (Pg 290):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Each morning, Monday through Thursday, Michelle and I began our days
with both Cornell [his athletic trainer] and Sam [his chef], the four of
us gathering in the small gym on the third floor of the residence…For
both Michelle and me, that daily hour in the gym became one more zone of
normalcy….”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Obama could find time for working out when he had one of the most
busiest and stressful jobs in the world, I can too.</p>
<p><strong>5. Mindset:</strong> Do it long enough and fitness becomes a
part of your identity. Daily choices start revolving around it. This
doesn’t go unnoticed and you experience a less-talked about problem: <a
href="https://blog.usejournal.com/do-we-have-a-fit-shaming-problem-bb63ab36989f">fit-shaming</a>.
You are shamed for your health choices (those judgemental eyes, gosh!).
Multiple fitness-focused friends have experienced this nuisance.</p>
<p>You eventually learn to ignore it. But I find it useful to keep the
big picture in mind and ask the most basic question: why am I even doing
this?</p>
<p>Which brings me to the distinction between two wildly different
motivations for staying fit: one is driven by aesthetics; the other
keeps good health at the center. While the path to achieve both ends is
the same, the reason to prioritise fitness (whether for external
validation or internal satisfaction) may have a huge impact on how you
feel about your workouts and its outcomes.</p>
<p>Staying healthy is my primary driver. I am not saying aesthetics
don’t matter to me: I feel good when I look good, or when the shirt I
like fits me well, or when a cute girl in the coffee shop cares to
notice my existence. But getting three extra right swipes on a dating
app can not be the reason to get off my bed at 5.30am to lift
dumbbells.</p>
<p>How I look has no direct impact on what I do on a day to day basis: I
am a knowledge worker and I get paid for reporting, writing, thinking
and coding. If I had a lot of extra time, I would spend it to sharpen my
mind. Not only does exercising my mind matter for my professional
growth, it is also the thing I enjoy the most: I have been a
specs-wearing nerd since teenage and losing a few inches around the
waist and adding some around the biceps is not going to change how I
think about myself.</p>
<p>In that sense, a commitment to fitness is a philosophical choice,
recognising that I can not fully cherish the gift of life and enjoy
things I love without good health. It is a commitment to treat the body
I occupy with the respect it deserves.</p>
<p>This is the push that made this one-year streak possible. All other
outcomes are amazing and great, but they remain secondary.</p>
