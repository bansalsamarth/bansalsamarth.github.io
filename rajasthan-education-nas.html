      <aside>In 2017, Rajasthan was both the best and the worst Indian
state in terms of learning outcomes. How did that happen?</aside>
    </p>
    

    <hr>


<p><img src="assets/images/interval-banner.png" /></p>
<p><em>This story was originally published in my fortnightly deep-dive
newsletter, <strong>The Interval</strong>. You can read more about it <a
href="./welcome-to-the-interval.html">here</a>.</em></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>2017 witnessed a governance miracle. Rajasthan, the <a
href="https://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-one-third-of-rural-population-illiterate-in-india-2101486?google_editors_picks=true">least
literate Indian state</a> was ranked the best in the National
Achievement Survey (NAS), the <a
href="https://pib.gov.in/newsite/printrelease.aspx?relid=173462">largest
ever student assessment</a> conducted by the government.</p>
<p>It was a big deal. Just two years before the exam, then Chief
Minister Vasundhara Raje acknowledged the poor quality of education and
announced her goal to <a
href="https://www.internationalnewsandviews.com/rajasthan-should-figure-in-education-top-10-states-in-education-vasundhara-raje/">break
into the top ten</a>.</p>
<p>The survey said her team delivered — and the world noticed.</p>
<p>The <em>Indian Express</em> published a <a
href="https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-happy-class-rajasthan-education-system-schools-5828109">two-page
centre-spread story</a> narrating the “education renaissance” in
Rajasthan. “Once a laggard in education,” the report said, the state
“has been working to make schools less dreary and more child-focused…The
results are visible.”</p>
<p>India’s then school education secretary Anil Swarup was gung-ho:
“Institutional reforms, innovative ideas and a commitment to improve has
resulted in this qualitative change,” <a
href="https://twitter.com/swarup58/status/977022551489679366">he
tweeted</a> when the survey results were out. “So much to learn…”</p>
<p>The Boston Consulting Group, the management consultancy Raje had
hired to assist her bureaucracy, took it further. The state’s jump from
#25 to #1, the company claimed, is proof that their big idea to fix
government schools — school mergers — works: “500,000 schools need to
shut down in India from a base of one million to improve education,”
BCG’s social impact director said in a <a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210515231209/https://www.bcg.com/industries/education/transforming-education-on-massive-scale">video
posted on the company’s website</a>.</p>
<p>My bullshit detector beeped when I saw these claims. Something was
off and I looked more closely.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edu-rajasthan-nas/gif-1.gif" /></p>
<p>There is one more national survey tracking student learning outcomes.
It’s called ASER. The education non-profit Pratham conducts it. Many in
the government hate it but they can’t ignore it. Since the mid-2000s,
ASER has exposed what Pratham calls the “learning crisis” in Indian
schools.</p>
<p>I checked <a
href="http://img.asercentre.org/docs/ASER%202021/ASER%20TOT%202012-18/rajasthan.pdf">ASER’s
2018</a> data. It told a different story. Forget transformation: the
state’s performance <em>fell down</em> compared to the previous 2016
round. Rajasthan was still <a
href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/jaipur/aser-report-raj-among-bottom-five-states-in-learning-outcomes/articleshow/67548987.cms">among
India’s worst states</a>.</p>
<p>In short, Rajasthan was both the best and the worst Indian state in
terms of learning outcomes, depending on the data you choose.</p>
<p>This was puzzling. How can two large-scale nationally-representative
surveys paint contrary pictures of the same state?</p>
<p>I made phone calls and got a simplistic answer: “the methodology is
different and you can’t compare the two surveys.” I was not convinced. I
already knew that. NAS and ASER measure different things in different
ways (<a
href="https://img.asercentre.org/docs/Bottom%20Panel/Key%20Docs/nas_stdvvs_aser.pdf">more
here</a>). But common sense said there was more to the story. I wanted
to know what really happened in Rajasthan.</p>
<p>So I started reporting. I visited government schools in rural Jaipur
to interview teachers, met government officials and partner consultants,
reviewed data and government documents and pieced together an answer I
can live with.</p>
<p>I won’t hold the suspense. My reporting suggests that NAS data is
junk. It’s garbage. If the data is the lens to assess performance, no
radical transformation happened in Rajasthan.  </p>
<p>This fictional transformation illustrates the underlying structure of
a society-wide problem: metrics-fixation and the urge to quantify
everything. Historian Jerry Muller calls it <a
href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174952/the-tyranny-of-metrics">the
tyranny of metrics</a>.</p>
<p>Measurement is not the problem, Muller says. Excessive measurement
and inappropriate measurement is. Unbounded metrics-fixation leads to
unintended negative consequences and corrupts the institutions it was
meant to improve. It shapes how we talk and think about the world.</p>
<p>This problem, Muller says, is spread across disciplines: schools,
medical care, businesses, and government. Solving the Rajasthan paradox
helped me understand it better. Let me show you how.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="i.-the-official-narrative">I. The official narrative</h3>
<p>I always try to understand how the people I write about think about
their work and look at the problem from their eyes. It helps to sketch
the world around questions I am trying to answer.  </p>
<p>So I called the man credited for the Rajasthan transformation: Naresh
Pal Gangwar, the state’s then education secretary.</p>
<p>“School education is a huge ecosystem,” he told me. “90 lakh kids.
40,000 villages. There were problems with the basic schooling structure.
Structural changes were required to reform the system.”</p>
<p><em>Structural change</em> is jargon and it appeared again and again
in my interviews with philanthropists, consultants and another state
education secretary.</p>
<p>The argument goes like this: Education policy is failing kids because
gaps exist on the administrative side. Management deficit is big. The
number of schools has increased. Student enrollment has increased. But
the managerial capacity to handle the new load has not. So good projects
start and they fail. This is the ignored aspect of education reform,
they say. Fixing it will yield long-term returns.</p>
<p>So that’s what Rajasthan did. Gangwar gave me a list. Small schools
were merged to function as one big model school. Teacher vacancies were
reduced from over 50% to 15%. Block officers were trained to build
mid-management capacity. Shala Darpan, an online dashboard, was launched
to track student-level data and improve information flows. And so
on.</p>
<p>In short, the state focused on delivery structures, governance,
transparency and accountability. The process of fixing these gaps,
Gangwar said, led to the ranking jump. There were other indicators too,
he said: “A reverse migration began. Students were leaving private
schools to join government schools.”</p>
<p>That is the official narrative.</p>
<p>Now look, my understanding of India’s education scene is not much
different from Elon Musk’s <a
href="https://www.vox.com/2018/5/24/17389388/elon-musk-twitter-pravda">understanding
of journalism</a>: I don’t know enough to grasp its complexity. So I
could not critically assess Gangwar’s reasoning.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edu-rajasthan-nas/gif-2.gif" /></p>
<p>I compensated for my ignorance with common sense and made one
assumption: Learning outcomes could not have improved if nothing changed
inside the classroom. Teachers had to be doing something different.
Sounds right?</p>
<p>Now it’s possible that administration efficiency improved classroom
learning. Teachers could have had more time to teach. Reduced vacancies
could have improved the teacher-student ratio. Data tracking could have
exposed inefficiencies and eased decision making.</p>
<p>So I booked a ticket for Jaipur and rode a bus for three days to
visit government schools and find out what changed. And things did in
fact change — just not in the way the administration wanted it to.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="ii.-schools-and-dashboards">II. Schools and dashboards</h3>
<p><img src="assets/images/edu-rajasthan-nas/jaipur-school.jpg" /></p>
<p>Teachers at the first two schools shot me puzzled looks when I asked
about NAS. They were not aware of the rankings which brought me to their
school. Oops.</p>
<p>So I stopped mentioning NAS and enquired what had changed over the
last few years. Some pointed to a newly constructed building and some
showed me wall paintings. Some mentioned new donation initiatives and
others highlighted school mergers. (None of the teachers I met wanted to
be identified. So I won’t disclose their names.)</p>
<p>But I mostly heard complaints, the same complaints teachers have told
researchers for years, and the most prominent one is also the one that
got worse: <a
href="https://www.news18.com/news/india/teachers-spend-only-19-of-their-time-in-educating-students-poll-duty-and-surveys-take-up-rest-1884135.html">teachers
were not finding enough time to teach</a>. Surveys, election duties and
block-level work ate up their time.</p>
<p>The new culprit was the dashboard the government was so proud of.
Here are three stories.</p>
<p><strong>One: Unnecessary data</strong></p>
<p>“Our school has 140 students. Officials sent doses for kids and gave
us two days to administer. We would do that, we always do that. But now
they want data. They asked us to report every single detail on the
dashboard like how many students took the medicine on the first day and
how many on the second day and who got ill and more. Why could they not
trust us to do our job? And even after entering the data, they called us
in ten days to ask for the same information. So what is the point? It
just wastes my time.”</p>
<p><strong>Two: Fake data</strong></p>
<p>“All that officials want are numbers on the dashboard. So I give them
that. For example, they asked us to organise fortnightly community
events. Students would show talent with parents in the audience. Good
idea. It could boost their confidence. But if parents don’t come, we are
scolded. What can I do? So I just say 20 parents turned up and officials
are happy to see that on the dashboard. Job done.”</p>
<p><strong>Three:Ghost students</strong></p>
<p>“Officials gave us instructions to stop dropouts and increase school
enrolment. We try. But if students drop out, we are blamed and we are
asked to get them back. How do we do that? So now, we don’t remove
dropouts from the dashboard. Just this morning, two parents came to say
their enrolled kids won’t join. But I didn’t strike off their names. Why
should I tell the truth?”</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if these were isolated incidents or systemically
spread across the system. I am not claiming all the data is fake.</p>
<p>But the anecdotes revealed a pattern: the government’s obsession with
quantification to fix administrative issues created incentives that led
to unintended consequences. They were not listening to the teachers and
kicking self-goals.</p>
<p>There was one principal who was happy with the dashboard because it
eased the promotion process and scholarship disbursement. But he was an
exception. Most teachers felt duped to play data-entry operator: the
system that was meant to reduce their workload increased it.</p>
<p>Two teachers told me about Gangwar’s administration style. The happy
principal was one, who fully supported whatever he did: “If the
government asks you to increase enrollment in schools by 10%, then you
have to get it done. If targets were not achieved, Gangwar sent notices
to teachers and officials. He could even transfer you.”</p>
<p>Gangwar won brownie points with teachers who loved his
carrot-and-stick approach. But he was making the well-documented
mistake: linking reward and punishment with performance invites gaming
of metrics. It skews incentives.</p>
<p>Something similar happened with NAS.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="iii.-the-letter-trail">III. The letter trail</h3>
<p>NAS is a survey. NCERT selects the schools using a statistical
methodology to avoid bias. Around 170 schools in each of India’s 700
districts were sampled. They were informed months in advance about their
selection.</p>
<p>The government says NAS is conducted (it’s an ongoing survey; the
2021 round happened last month) to diagnose problems and guide education
policy, planning and implementation.</p>
<p>So when a school principal told me he was called for a NAS training
session, it made no sense. “What would they be trained for?” I wondered.
This principal spoke in a matter-of-fact tone and did not offer much
details or insight.</p>
<p>But he had given me a lead to explore more. I looked for government
documents mentioning “NAS training” which led me to a series of
revealing letters.</p>
<p>On 19 June 2017, five months before the exam, education <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/164lWp4KNfu1q4jmbhwSJwVDdVRcQ6zLk/view?usp=sharing">secretary
Gangwar informed state officials about NAS</a>. He told them its results
will feed in state education rankings. So officials should start
preparing. Rajasthan’s learning levels should be better than others, he
wrote.</p>
<p>The letter ended with a warning: “Do remember that disciplinary
action will be taken against district education officers whose
district’s learning levels fall below the average”. Wow.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edu-rajasthan-nas/letter-1.png" /></p>
<p><em>Letter dated June 19, 2017. <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/164lWp4KNfu1q4jmbhwSJwVDdVRcQ6zLk/view?usp=sharing">Link
to the full letter</a>.</em></p>
<p>Here again, the same mistake: punishment was linked with performance
metrics.</p>
<p>“The puzzle is now half-solved,” I told myself at the first glance of
this letter.</p>
<p>But there was more.</p>
<p>One letter mentions a two-day NAS training for school principals,
confirming what I had picked up in my reporting. Sample papers were
created. Hard copies were shared with principals of schools selected for
NAS. All of this is mentioned in the letters.</p>
<p>In September, officials were concerned that the upcoming Dussehra
holiday would affect NAS results. “So effective preparation should be
done through additional classes and coaching,” <a
href="“Effective%20preparation%20should%20be%20done%20for%20NAS%20through%20additional%20classes%20and%20coaching.”">the
letter said</a>.</p>
<p>On October 5, five weeks before the exam, officials were asked to
assign “holiday homework” during the Diwali break for NAS
preparation.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edu-rajasthan-nas/letter-2.png" /></p>
<p><em>Letter dated October 5, 2017. <a
href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/164lWp4KNfu1q4jmbhwSJwVDdVRcQ6zLk/view?usp=sharing">Link
to the full letter</a></em>.</p>
<p>The letters made it clear: state officials were preparing kids for a
competitive exam—not a diagnostic exam. They wanted to win and shine in
the rankings.</p>
<p>The state’s effort was directed away from its core purpose —
education — to hitting a metric target. Critics of standardized testing
call it “<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teaching_to_the_test">teaching to
the test”,</a> a practice where the education system narrowly focuses on
the test and not the general curriculum.</p>
<p>There is no sign where officials signalled the exam will help
diagnose problems. (And teachers I interviewed did not receive any
feedback from NAS.)</p>
<p>You can imagine what this would have led to.</p>
<p><img src="assets/images/edu-rajasthan-nas/gif-3.gif" /></p>
<p>But one question still remained: what exactly happened on the day of
the exam?</p>
<p>You can guess my hypothesis: just like teachers entered fake data in
the Shala Darpan dashboard to hit performance metrics, cheating would
have happened on exam day to avoid punishment.  </p>
<p>But I wanted proof. Something that confirms my theory. I tried
finding NAS invigilators. I could not. I found a list of schools where
NAS was conducted and landed at two of them. Teachers didn’t say much.
In one school, I was sent to a classroom where students had appeared for
NAS and asked them to describe what they remember of the day. I did some
really terrible reporting. No one told me anything. Kids just laughed at
me.</p>
<p>I was so frustrated at my inability to crack this last bit and looked
online to read what the local press had reported. I was assuming they
would have simply carried the government’s version. I could not be more
wrong.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="iv-exam-day">IV: Exam day</h3>
<p>On the morning of November 13, 2017, journalist Devendra Singh was
running around schools in the state’s Nagaur district to report a story
for his then-employer, <em>Rajasthan Patrika</em>. It was the day of the
NAS exam.</p>
<p>What Singh saw could not be called an exam. Teachers and students sat
together. Students who could not read the question paper had marked the
right answers. The same kids could not answer the same questions after
the exam.</p>
<p>Singh <a
href="https://www.patrika.com/nagaur-news/national-achievement-survey-named-after-the-joke-1996843/">published
his eye-witness account in the next day’s paper</a>: “NAS became a
joke,” he wrote. I called up Singh to confirm, just to be sure. “Yes, it
was a complete sham. NAS ranking has no meaning. It is totally bogus,”
Singh told me.</p>
<p>My confidence in Singh’s account strengthened when I read <a
href="https://www.patrika.com/dausa-news/national-achievement-survey-1996298/">another
report in Patrika from Dausa district</a> with similar observations:
“Students were helped to improve the ranking of the school and make the
district look better. There was no secrecy.”</p>
<p>Singh asked teachers why they were doing this.</p>
<p>You know why.</p>
<p>“Why should our school result be down? We will be penalised for
students’ poor performance,” Singh recalled one teacher telling him.</p>
<p><em>I remember thinking at the time: “How unfortunate. The government
conducted this big exercise — the largest ever student assessment survey
— to manufacture junk? What a waste of public resources!”</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="v.-yeah-we-know">V. “Yeah, we know!”</h3>
<p>I had my answer. But I wanted to be sure and asked people who should,
in theory, defend NAS.</p>
<p><strong>District officer:</strong> A district project coordinator
agreed to speak if I don’t use his name. I told him what I found. Was he
surprised? Would he contest my findings?</p>
<p>He didn’t.</p>
<p>“Gaps remained in the monitoring system,” he acknowledged. “People
sent for monitoring didn’t do their jobs properly.”</p>
<p>“Teachers <em>may</em> have supported students. They thought poor
student performance will lead to penalties. I specifically told them
this was a survey to assess the learning levels of kids and results will
help send suggestions to the central government. But they ignored this
part and thought it was just sweet talk,” he said.</p>
<p>I interrupted and mentioned Gangwar’s letters: “That’s exactly the
problem. One such circular went viral on social media and teachers were
left concerned.”</p>
<p><strong>Central Square Foundation employee:</strong> Then I took what
I found to a source in the Delhi-based Central Square Foundation. They
partnered with NCERT to conduct NAS 2017. I was hoping he would defend
it.</p>
<p>He didn’t.</p>
<p>“It is junk. Entire government machinery knows that NAS is junk,” he
said, a claim I obviously can’t verify.</p>
<p>The problem was the government had made NAS so high stakes, he said.
“People were flown to Arunachal Pradesh to conduct the test. NAS used to
happen on a small scale. But they increased the sample and it was huge.
Some states didn’t even realise its importance. Now they do.”</p>
<p>It can get worse as NITI Aayog is using it to rank states, he said.
“Chief Ministers now want to know how states are preparing for NAS.
There are ongoing discussions to tie education budgets with NAS
ranking,” he said, concerned about how poor quality data is informing
policy decisions.</p>
<p>“Data is good as long as it is supportive. When it starts dictating,
it loses its purpose.”</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="vi.-what-does-this-mean">VI. What does this mean?</h3>
<p>You can blame Gangwar and consultants for this whole mess. You can
say things could have been different with a different bureaucrat. Maybe.
But I am not sure.</p>
<p>He did what he thought the state needed: administrative reforms. And
he did what his Chief Minister asked him to do: get high up in rankings.
He did not give orders for state-wide cheating.</p>
<p>Gangwar was part of the system obsessed with data and metrics. That
system imposed incentives — from the Chief Minister at the top of the
hierarchy to the teacher at the bottom — that did not align with the
goal of education. That system is the problem.</p>
<p>Few folks I shared this story with said the solution is more and
better data. “What we need is an improved version of NAS,” one
consultant said. “And NAS is on the right path. Its flaws will be fixed
with time.”</p>
<p>This is a dominant view. Students assessments are only growing.
Private testing companies are emerging. They are building tech so that
every single student can be regularly tested.  </p>
<p>I love data and I am all for quantification. But reporting this story
and looking at the system made me question: are we missing the root
cause of the problem? Is more data really the solution? Is it possible
to isolate this metrics-focused system from the perverse incentives it
creates?</p>
<p>Are we being blinded by metrics?</p>
<p>I don’t know. I am thinking about it.</p>
<p>While reporting this story, many people said I must speak to Krishna
Kumar, a former director of NCERT and a critic of standardised testing,
including ASER and Pratham. He opposes the outcome-driven approach.</p>
<p>“This is a polarised dialogue,” he said. “There is no communication
happening across the table between people who believe that
outcomes-driven is the way forward and those who don’t see outcomes as
the real concern for education. In this polarity, we are missing where
we were heading before and are heading now.”</p>
<p>And he explained his concern with an example. A few years ago, the
Haryana Government organised an education conference at the Jindal
Global University.</p>
<p>What he starkly remembers are the concluding statements of his
co-panellist, Haryana’s then education secretary. “I am sorry to share
with you this fact,” Kumar recalls the secretary as saying, “that today
90% of the upper-caste of Haryana are in private schools and 90% of
lower-caste children are in government schools. This degree of social
polarisation is very dangerous for learning any kind of social
values.”</p>
<p>Kumar, the educationist, finds this worrying. “When you isolate
skills, competency and outcomes from children’s social background, you
are creating a discourse sharply devoid of any context of education. The
secretary was pointing this out precisely. What kind of society are we
creating?” he said.</p>
<p>“Soon after, the terrible riots of Rohtak took place, and I was
reminded of his statement at that time. Haryana is really running two
societies and two systems of schools.”</p>
<p>The concerns of Kumar are not captured by any numbers. That is not a
metric anyone is looking at.</p>
